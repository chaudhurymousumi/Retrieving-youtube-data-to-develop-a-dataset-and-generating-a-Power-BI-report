I went to school to 16 and then I stayed on a couple of a levels available in travel and tourism and got one in business studies. I\\'ve done a little bit of work worked on the campsite. I\\'ve done a little bit of working in a travel agents worked at a local swimming pool when I started I started just like I was at university and I left. I went into the job market straight away. I got a job in the airline and that\\'s where I was trained And I worked there for 80 years and it was really good. I was climbing up the ladder as I went on. It\\'s very good. You know, if you have the support, I was lucky, I had someone support me there within the airline. So what I would do for you today, you would just see me as somebody who would be there by the side to help you to climb up that ladder by meeting people getting your CV done correctly and all those things. That\\'s why I\\'m here. That\\'s what we\\'re going to work on as a mentor would help you to develop some skills if you don\\'t have them, but skills that you already have, that, I would help you with them as well. So that would be like I would work with you once one. Yeah, that sounds, that sounds good. If we\\'re going to be working on that sort of stuff then that\\'s a lot better than I thought with the job center. Yes. They\\'re happy for me just just for work in general. Whereas I\\'m wanting to go down. You\\'ve just said we can wait down the Travel and Tourism. This is what I\\'m wanting to do. Well, yeah, I think it\\'s, I think it\\'s where I\\'m heading. I will get some contact. I\\'ll give you some websites where you can actually go online into some job sites and make the jobs that you want to do. So you need to just work within that line and then hopefully, hopefully you get something. Um this is the mentoring stat form to show that we have an agreement that we\\'re going to be working together as a team. Yes, and the second one you need to fill out at the end of the session, it would have all your details on it, we will communicate by email or my mobile phone, you would have to complete your CV. Just bring what you\\'ve got, we\\'ll walk through it so that we can profile your CV according to the job that you want to apply and then start to start applying for jobs, but we will meet next month at the end of the month, you know, like we just did at the time, so I\\'ll get that CV CV done, then I\\'ll get that straight away and then we can bring that in and start to work in the first scenario we\\'re covering, sort of, the introductory stage. So the mentor and the mentee are starting to build the rapport between themselves, that they\\'ll discuss the ground rules, how they can be contacted, where the location of the mentoring sessions will start to take place and it may be that some sort of initial career aspirations have started to be drawn into the equation, this is what','Reality'),\n",

I am thinking about how you told me that last year when your son got married and you were very busy, quite happy that somehow your symptoms seemed less and that when your husband is away, which is something you do not like very much. Sometimes somehow your symptoms then will seem greater.

I am also thinking about the tablets that you are taking and the fact that you seem to be taking quite a lot of them and wondering whether it is worth of sitting and looking at them and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse.

I've done a little bit of working in a travel agents worked at a local swimming pool when I started I started just like I was at university and I left. I went into the job market straight away.

Yes, and the second one you need to fill out at the end of the session, it would have all your details on it, we will communicate by email or my mobile phone, you would have to complete your CV. Just bring what you've got, we'll walk through it so that we can profile your CV according to the job that you want to apply and then start to start applying for jobs, but we will meet next month at the end of the month, you know, like we just did at the time, so I'll get that CV CV done, then I'll get that straight away and then we can bring that in and start to work in the first scenario we're covering, sort of, the introductory stage. So the mentor and the mentee are starting to build the rapport between themselves, that they'll discuss the ground rules, how they can be contacted, where the location of the mentoring sessions will start to take place and it may be that some sort of initial career aspirations have started to be drawn into the equation, this is what','Reality'),\n",
