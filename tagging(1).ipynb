F perspective, which to me means that I'm focusing on the person, not necessarily the problem. Why is it that this smart, creative, whole resourceful person is having difficulty to resolve to get where she wants to go. So yes, we do have to have a goal. We have to have a definition destination. So we know where we're going, but it's about more about being present. So I want to put some of the stereotypes to rest about, you know, I. C. F. Coaching. It's not all questions. Um coaching in our definition is a reflective inquiry process. So you're gonna notice that I use reflective techniques is as much as questions that I summarize that I just, I want a roar to hear what she's saying so she can stop and think about it because it's more about holding up the mirror, how can I best do that so she can see you know what's going on with her in a way that she can objectively understand it instead of being caught in it in her head. And so at times I may give information, information is not the same as giving solutions and and that's okay. Um I use a lot of closed questions um to help clarify, but I think the main thing is that she feels safe with me, safe to share what's on her mind, um what's going on with her and that I'm just, you know, receiving what she's giving me and giving it back to her to see if we can't understand it better that will help her to move forward. So sometimes in coaching, you know, your client just needs a sounding board to talk things through. I've had clients where I hardly say anything but just ask a question every now and then, um and just clarify if that's what's helpful for them. Um So they can see new options, but but in particularly when your client is circling, resisting going down side roads and getting stuck in their thinking, which we all do and then it really is about coaching the person. So they can, you know, see through that that thing that's getting in their way, they need to discover what's blocking them so they can determine what's next. So I always say in this type of coaching, you're there thinking partner, you're not, that's why I say you're not doing it for them, you're helping them, again, this smart, this creative, resourceful person to think through what's getting in her way of getting what she wants. So um when I we're going to focus today on the reflective process because I think it's most misunderstood and in the I. C. F. Competencies it's one of my favorite is direct communication and I think it's really misunderstood. It's not about challenging. Although it may feel that way. It's not critiquing. It's not advising. It's not pushing. Um It's an interesting thing. The word direct has so many biases and misinterpretations. You know I teach a lot in asia and they're like well we're not direct but it's not about you know getting in someone's face. It's just about again about sharing. It's really about reflecting what you see what you hear what you notice and a lot of you know I teach a lot about how to open your heart and your gut. So it might be sharing what you're sensing. Um And you could be wrong. That's okay if I'm wrong. I'm sure Aurora will tell me and then she'll tell me what it really is for her and that means we're going deeper. So um it's the reflective process that I really feel is so valuable and I'd love for you to to really notice what I'm noticing how I share with her receive what she's giving me and give it back to her. You know some people say but isn't that interpreting well it is sometimes hard to to not interpret what you're sensing and like I said, that's in a sense, we don't want to push them into. No, no, I think you mean this, but you offer it, you know, I think this is what's going on. What do you think? And then let them tell you what it really is. So, I will often use the words I noticed I heard I sent um let me see if I've got it right. Um so this is what you're telling me. So you're gonna hear me say that a lot. So again, I'd like you to, you know, listen for that. So, um what am I reflecting? I'm reflecting what I see because I get a chance to see her. Although most of my clients and and and arora was my client years ago. I can't even remember like what it was like 10 years ago or something 48, 8 years ago. Right? But but we was always on the phone. So getting to see you as a luxury. But you can still hear patterns and emotionally charged statements shifts. The shift is always the key. If there's a shift in an emotion, there's something going on and you want to be very curious about that as best as you can though. Use their words that will keep you from too much interpretation. Use their words and just share what you notice and try not to add in your opinion and your judgment and if I do that you can ding me on it. I'm really okay, so I'm really looking forward to the questions and and answers uh uh you know, see if I can answer your questions, see what you say, see what you saw and what I do know is there's many different ways to coach um and you may take a different path and you may hear something differently. That's great, please share that as well. Okay, so I'm going to turn my sharing off and there we are. So are you okay? Are you comfortable? I am very comfortable um I think it's great to see so many':('people','Reality-self'),\n",

Um I also hear your great passion for having people give their all what you do because what you do has a great impact. And so that sense that they're not doing that you use the word entitlement a lot. So, so, so that's where we're going is for them, you would like to have conversations where they fully embrace what it is they need to do in order to move forward, correct':('correct.','Reality-self'),\n",
        "                                          'see as entitlement and oftentimes is you have a task that you have to do. You know, we use project planning tools, so the tasks are clearly outlined um And you do it, but it's not done necessarily 100% um correctly right? Or or it could be improved or sometimes uh in in in in the work, sometimes you just change your mind right. Um and the fact that you do it once and you feel entitled to being congratulated for finishing a task um that might not have been well done is what I find that sense of entitlement, like completing a task doesn't mean you've done it correctly or that it is the end. Um And you there's always room for improvement. And and in an agile world we need to change things along the way. So so sometimes it might be even my own unclear direction, which is sometimes what I tried to think about is what I wasn't clear um Exactly on on what it was needed. Um But the sense of entitlement comes on. I already did it, I did it. Um But what is the quality of that work is what I put into question and again it goes back into maybe my standards, my standards are this level and you know, and I even uh and I even made it make it explicit or clear, you know what the standards were and that's where sometimes I I think I could improve. Um But it does bother me at a. M at a basic level that first initial reaction if I already did it, you know, you really did what you asked me to do. So uh it's more about that that they're not meeting the standard that you appreciate, not that they want to be celebrated. I saw that you didn't like that.

Um like uh you know young adults uh just graduating from college and entering into entry level positions, I see this a lot. They need this constant reinforcement that they're doing a good job and I think it's fine to to do that, I guess for me going back to whether you want to call it values or something, it's it's a bit much for me to constantly be telling someone you're doing a good job or sometimes I even feel you are right, I think it's you know, it's your you're supposed to do, right? Um So I think that is either, you know, generational kind of thing more so as I said, when you go younger in in millennials, you know the 20 to 20 23 year olds coming into into level positions. Um or sometimes I um at that relation level, you know, it's it's a little challenging, right? Um I need to understand where they come from and I need to motivate them. I sometimes feel it's a bit much right, but that's my personal. Yeah, no I understand and I a bit much, that's right, that's what I hear from you that that that constant recognition, especially when you don't think they're they're living up to the expectations or the quality of the work. But let me ask you if the person really was doing good work and and living up to that, would it bother you? No. So it's really about the relationship of wanting recognition for work.

So for me, um, it is what I feel, I feel that maybe I'm not doing the, the ongoing support that they need in a mindful way, right? It's almost like peaks, right?

So I want to come back and just focus instead of the cross functional, which is a different conversation, but, so it's sounding to me, it's just a few of your direct reports that seem to have be a little high maintenance, um, and that you're struggling with finding the balance of being, you know, having them just do their work and constantly that bouncing back to, oh, now they're thinking of going and I have to pay more attention to them.

Than with you know, other people I've managed in the past um were you know if you were just to define in two sentences um that difference that makes it difficult for you, What would that be? Mm I would say the I would say what makes it difficult for me is what it takes to push people to go the extra mile. Okay, so would you say that what you're searching for with those people? Mhm. So is this a matter of would tell me which is bigger, your problems with their behavior or your sense that you're not doing it right? I think it's the sense that I am not doing it right to engage them at that level too uh to go the extra mile and this is obviously now what I'm going to tell you is as I have always done right, this is where you reflect you know, my own expectation and my drive for doing things and I know I cannot do that to other people obviously, but there is that subliminal message of what can I do so that they that they love it as much as I do or so that they do it, you know in a way that um that at the end of that is good for the business obviously.

Well, do you know the range of passion that's acceptable for, you know what I think also depends on the role, right? Yeah.

Um because you're talking about tough love, you know, and and and I just want to check in, So, tough love is being very clear about what needs to be done and when it's not being done correct, we have the same definition and uh we're really showing a passion and um that not expecting you to always give them things and acknowledge them and all that other stuff. The emotional stuff that they might need, that you would really just prefer them to be passionate about their work. It's sort of different. But yeah, I hear it overlaps.

Is there a way that you can separate your your judgment and bias which you said you had at the beginning that and only focus on the results. Is that something that is possible I think um is it is it possible to separate them? You've got to separate them because that's where you have goals and objectives and and how you measure people. So I think you need to measure people by by the outcomes of what they do. Um and I strongly believe that um I think to separate that out with the attitude towards work, right? Um that kind of that's hard to measure um and therefore I don't think it should be something that is used against anybody for any reason.

I honor that you're willing to do that? And also then what conversations you might have with them and how it relates to their values? You know, you're taking this a deeper level. So I think that's a great part of leadership and I and I honor your courage for wanting to do that. So you say you want to do it. So when do you think you might have these conversations? I think probably as soon as next week I have a deadline september 3rd, so as soon as I mean my deadline okay on that, some conversations, so you're good. Is there anything that you need, anything that could get in the way? No, I I really just, I'm like a little bit dumbfounded that I never thought about telling them where I was necessarily where, you know, where I was coming from at that value level, right? It's much easier to have a conversation at a, you know, you need to do X, Y or C. This is the project plan, these are the objectives, these are the priorities, you know, like we've talked about this and so I tend to have more, you know, a little bit of those conversations or where do you want to go in your career and let me help you get there as opposed to this is where necessarily where I'm coming from, so that's okay.

I didn't choose to be the chairman of this, but I am on the team of five co chairs. So I have a pretty big role and we're talking hundreds of people that come to one place and a lot of Moving parts and I've been really clear from day one where where I I'm strong and what I love to do and where it stops and what I'm noticing is sort of like at the school, you know, where things creep in, surprise new activities creep in that I didn't plan for.

When she asked that he went to his head, It almost sounded like he was reading his resume for his volunteer activities more so than what's his internal experience? The opportunity here, I think is to explore something that means something internally. To steve even mentioned the word commitment.

One opportunity here though I noticed is that linda asked a specific question. What is your desire now with relation to that hours essentially that you want to work. What if she had just stopped that? What is your desire now? Instead of moving to kind of the head space? The whole person space of what is your desire for the experience that you want?

Talking about, I have many questions but I think the most important one right now is to ask you what outcome you want, what's the impact66 if the coach loses that preamble and just focuses on the question, what is the outcome you're looking for from this session, there are a couple of other choice points that can be offered here and again, there is no perfect coaching session, it is all just a series of choice points, but one is, we could have explored a little bit more around the session agreement. We have the topic and the outcome. One of the questions that comes up for me is what is the underlying, underlying meaning of the coaching topic for steve today? That is to say of all the things he could have brought to coaching today. Why is it this topic today? Why is it important to him now? Often that helps deepen the conversation to that internal experience for the client. Another choice point is that steve had just shared this worldview of reciprocity, there's an opportunity to explore that a little bit.

She's offering the client an opportunity to choose where to go next. This is a great example of seeing her client as home resourceful, capable and creative and a great example of partnering and then we see a little bit of levity as they laugh about the list and she's really mirroring the client's energy there.

I want an engagement where I look forward to it. Where it's fun where I don't know, this one may or may not stand less where there's some physical activity involved. Yes, become somewhat sedentary, not a desk time, right in the seat time. Yeah. So yeah. So, so where, where the engagement itself requires movement. Mhm. Mhm. Where there's learning on both sides? Ah mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah, that feels like equal exchange when you say that you know like part of systems theory where there's learning on both sides?

The things I was curious about is your um your essence statement and your values as you look towards those in this context.

And I think there was an opportunity to deepen the learning around that list a little bit, perhaps asking steve now that you said that out loud, how does that feel or what have you learned about yourself and listing out these these qualities and attributes?

And there is a choice point here as well which is to check in with a client and ask steve what is happening for him right now linda also artfully acknowledged a motion that she saw within steve which led to an insight for him. And she acknowledged that by saying that's powerful steve. So giving him some affirmation around that insight and there's an opportunity to take that inside a little bit deeper. Anytime you notice that there's something powerful, it may be useful to ask the question of what is happening for you now, now that you have that insight or what do you want to do with that insight? One other noticing I had in this section, maybe you noticed it too. I noticed linda taking a lot of notes here. It brings to me a question of simply what does the impact of breaking that eye contact looking down at the paper And writing notes have on the relationship at that point moment. Might she be missing some visual clues by taking notes. Taking notes as a personal preference. So I invite you to consider what is really important to take down and what can you leave off of the paper so that you can focus and be present with your client. Mhm.\":(\" What does being intentional about it do for you? Well, um first thought that causes it to happen. Yeah. Uh so the quality of the experience is significantly um so back to the quality of the engagement. Yes, that list of things materialize as a result of being intentional that come to be hmm hmm Yeah, it's good. And I was just gonna ask, we're getting close to the end. Just gonna ask if there's anything else it feels um from your non verbal and verbal that there's a place of settling here. Um is there anything else? So the what else before me is is that I want that list. I will get it to you right after we finish here. I wanna I wanna take that list. I wanna um with the impact of bringing generative homeless to all my interactions. What then are opportunities that put those two together?\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \"The coach again asks a really powerful question here about what is the impact of being intentional to you? Beautiful internal question focused on the client. The coach also noticed the settling that she sensed. So she did notice what was happening in the field with the client. And then she followed up with what else, what else do you need? And steve started listing some action items. Now since there was some time pressure here because they both mentioned the time. But despite that I think there was an opportunity to really anchor some of the insights from this session. It may have been something as simple as you mentioned that you wanted to focus on these attributes and qualities of volunteer opportunities. Where are we with that? Or it could simply be, what have you learned about yourself in this session does really take that learning to the next step and helps bring a natural closure to the session as well. One other choice point is after listing those action items might have been an opportunity to check in with what support do you need to see this through or what accountability do you want? That helps deepen the learning and forward the action.\":(\" Yeah. Um I wanna gosh, I want to really acknowledge you um for you know, the the generative wholeness way in which you are approaching this question, you know, to really think through um what your interests are and what you want to have happen from the experience before looking for a particular place to go and to volunteer, you know, to search for those qualities and understand what it is that's important to you as you express yourself and make an impact. So really acknowledge you for that. I yes, I think it's a approach that um I could recommend to some of my clients as they talk about these things. You know what I mean? Yes, I do. Because a lot of people that I speak with are engaged in volunteer activities and struggling whether they want to put their energies in those places anymore. So thank you for that. You gave me a real gift. So I'm realizing here you're welcome and I realized that this is the I am model. Yes and I almost said that earlier because it is intention. You finished the sentence plus uh manifestation? Yes, that is such a powerful model. It really is. Thank you. Well, thank you for this session today. I think we're from my perspective at our end. How about you? Thank you.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",

We're largely talking about drugs such as psilocybin, magic mushroom juice uh or GMT, which is generally now used as ayahuasca. These are serotonin ergic agonist drugs which produced quite a classical psychedelic states that reported famously, of course, under the influence of mescal in by Aldous Huxley in his book the doors of perception. There's also some debate as to whether ketamine or s ketamine, these good dramaturgical antagonists which are now being used for depression, a psychedelic, certainly they do produce changes in brain activity, rather similar to the the serotonin ergic drugs, but they're not subjectively quite the same. But it may be that they both work in a sense, in the same way to have their clinical effects.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \"Right? So the word psychedelics and hallucinogens are they sort of used interchangeably?\":(\" They often are. Yes. So people often talk of the serotonin ergic hallucinogens like LSD or psilocybin. Ayahuasca, um psychedelic was a term that was developed by Huxley to explain the effect, which is mind revealing. And that in itself is a very interesting choice of words, greek words because it's that's kind of what we are using them for now. We're not using them for the hallucinations, which is often seen negative, although many people find them quite pleasant, the particular visual hallucinations. But the purpose of using these drugs is to have to make changes in the way people understand themselves and to disrupt, Let me use them clinically, we're trying to disrupt maladaptive patterns of our behavior and in fact just, you know, jumped the gun a bit, but when we look to when we're using psilocybin as we've been doing that, we've done two trials of psilocybin for depression resistant depression. And and mine revealing is quite important because there are two elements to this. The first is that depressed people when they go through the trip, they often see the reasons why they're depressed for the first time in maybe ever. They've understood why they're depressed. They can reveal the nature or some of the at least the factors which lead to depression. And of course the other thing is about them is that they can open the mind to new solutions so people can think differently. People can sometimes come to terms with their abuser for instance, in a trip and actually get closure. I prefer the term psychedelic to hallucinogenic.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \"Um Now LSD um was initially I think um sort of discovered in 1938 somewhere around there and in the 19 sixties had a had a significant sort of focus, you know, highlights. Um and I think tim leary, the Harvard professor, quite charismatic, talked about young people to sort of Turn in and sort of drop out and you know, go against convention. Um and from what I understand in the 1960s there was this resurgence with lots of research papers, large number of trials, international conferences and psychedelics were present the question, what happened afterwards?\":(\" Well, as with all great developments, politics got in the way it was the Vietnam war that these drugs were seen and were being a revolution in psychiatry and clinical neuroscience and then the Vietnam war was going badly. People american young americans were opposing the war. People will be caught up at the age of 18 depending on whether their birthday ended an order and even number they could be sent to this country that we've never heard of to fight an enemy they'd never see for a cause they didn't understand in a place that was disgustingly hot and full of mosquitos and they didn't, you know, for the first few years they went innocently thinking they were going to change the world and then info came back. People came back, the bodies came back, the broken, you know, the invalids came back and then the war started challenging the purpose of the war. It was not only destroying american men but it was also destroying an awful lot of south asian women and Children as well. So the war antiwar protest started and some of the potential soldiers escaped to Canada. Others went to san Francisco. LSD was becoming used now in more in art and in music and it was LSD was seen as fueling the anti war movement. Of course it wasn't but it was an excuse to get the drug band and so they were bound then and they've been basically banned and they're still bound. Now there's no country in the world where LSD is a legal drug hmm\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \"interesting. So when we you touched on briefly sort of the mechanism of of action. But if we had to go a bit deeper as psychiatrists as mental health professionals to understand in terms of receptors um how do psychedelics act? Yes.\":()    \n",
        "                                          \"So let's so let's focus completely now on the on the clinical you use ones which are psilocybin, magic mushroom juice and ayahuasca which is D. M. T. Juice. So ayahuasca just so everyone understands D. M. T. Is a very short acting serotonin ergic psychedelic. The effect lasts about five minutes. The if you and if you give it intravenously if you take it it doesn't work orally. So so the only way to use it orally is in this combination called Ayahuasca and ayahuasca is a combination of a plant that has D. M. T. In it and a plant that makes a mon away min oxidase inhibitor. So psychiatrists know about those but this one is called harmony and it's not a clinical one but it comes out of a plant. So you drink a tea made of the to the harm align, prevents the breakdown of the D. M. T. And the liver and the gut. So the D. M. T. From the stomach can go through into the brain. So D. M. T. Is a you know it's a a serotonin ergic and psychedelics like psilocybin and both of those. Now there are clinical trial data with both those drugs. So how do they work? Well they stimulate their agonists at the five HT two A receptor. And that receptor is a very interesting receptor for humans and for psychiatry because the human brain has more of those receptors than any other brain evolution In primates and other species has shown that the human brain is particularly endowed with these five HT 2 a receptors. So what are they there for? Well there aren't neurons which control cross cortical information as you probably know that the brain is essentially a A collection of billions 150 billion little computers. It's called a parameter cell. And the first level processing of everything in the brain is done by these parameter cells in cortical columns. But then the connectivity that pulling together things like seeing, hearing, thinking that's done by these the layer five pyramidal cells. They they they integrate brain function to make the brain the amazing organ it is. And those cells having are very well endowed with the two A receptor. We don't know why we have theories and I'll come back to that later if you want. But those are very densely the receptors are densely expressed on these layer five pyramidal cells. When you stimulate those receptors with say psilocybin, you dramatically change the function. In fact you you effectively you disrupt across cortical communication and that breaks down the ongoing patterns of neural activity which are underpin everything we do and that is why the psychedelic state is a very different state. That's why people feel differently. They often they feel that their bodies are changing. They often feel that they floating out into space. They often go to new other universes or other dimensions because the normal control of your brain is broken down and it's in that state when you disrupt typical classic, you know, your traditional day by day, minute by minute ongoing thinking that you can think differently. And that is the mind revealing aspect of of the psychedelic.\"\n",
        "                                          \"coming to um psilocybin, you have touched on psilocybin. What would be the current indications for psilocybin? The current landscape?\":(\" Well it's interesting because it's I mean so we now there are there are open trials uh in tobacco smoking helping people quit some the matt Hopkins matt johnson stuff from johns Hopkins. There's an open trial by Michael boudin shoots in helping maintain or reduce maintain abstinence or reduce alcohol intake in alcoholism. There's our open trial in resistant depression and a very small trial. So there's 4 4 trials of psilocybin in four different disorders you might say well what what brings it in? How can it work in addiction and depression? And I think this is where the neuroscience is particularly exciting because it's the in each of these cases almost certainly it's the same disruptive process. So what does that tell us about the disorders? Well these disorders are, the way I interpret these data is to say that these are all internalizing disorders in depression. People are ruminating about past mistakes and failures and guilt in addiction. People are ruminating about the tobacco or ruminating about the alcohol. You know O. C. D. People are ruminating about cleanliness. So I think they're all internalizing disorders. They're all disorders that people resist. People don't want to be where they don't these thoughts happen but they can't stop them and psychedelics disrupt them And uh you know let me get one of the, perhaps the greatest insight that Huxley produced in the doors of perception. He said, well, what happened? I took masculine, he said, and my mind opened, I understood things, my mind understood things that had never understood before. My mind was effectively released and then he went on to make the logical conclusion. That means something is constraining my mind. What's that? Well, the only thing that can be is the brain. So he said, the brain is an instrument for focusing the mind and psychedelics break down that ability. And that's what we've shown in the brain scanning has actually shown that that's what happens. And so in these different conditions, people's brains are dominating their minds, They're getting locked into thinking they don't want to be locked into and we can just break down the brain, take away the brain's control, let the mind run free for a bit and hopefully come up with a new solution, a new approach. It is, it is quite remarkable. The tobacco data are really quite, really fascinating because when you talk to Hopkins and in fact, you can listen on the drug science website, you can listen to my podcast with him and he says, what, when you talk to people who've given up smoking, it wasn't that they reduce their consumption basically was all or nothing. 3/4 of the people in that study, they never smoked again. They just said, smoking has no interest to me at all, Like it has for most people who don't smoke, it kind of reframed them and put them away from, from ever ever thinking about smoking. So it was a kind of completely remodeling their, their affiliation with what used to be the love object. So that's where we are at present now, what's coming, what's happening? There's been too controlled trials in people in with end of life, anxiety and depression, both from the johns Hopkins group, one from the new york University group, they both show that they help people reduce anxiety and depression, which obviously commonly occurs when people are told they're gonna die. We've now completed and it's going to be published hopefully next month, the head to head, the first, head to head of psilocybin versus S Attallah prom, I think you're gonna find those results very interesting. And, and and I suppose in terms of the conventional drug development compass pathways in America and europe instead of a multi center study Of basically an efficacy and sort of Phase three efficacy study where you, what it is a sort to be stopped three. So where you have three doses one mg, which is placebo, effectively a 10 mg, a minute dose and a 25 mg, which is a kryptos. And I'm really looking forward to those results because I suspect they're going to show that 25 is very, very effective compared with one and 10 is probably going to have some effect, but not everything\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \"right. And I guess this fits in with the recent study which I understand you were a part of Robin Carhart Harris as well. And uh on on micro dozing. And I think just a few days ago where they attributed, I think the headline was very much about, you know, um the use of psychedelics being or the benefits of psychedelics being due to placebo experience. Would you like to sort of expand on on that aspect?\":(\" Sure. Well, so we did uh is an extremely the leader of of Dallas was the, it was his brilliant vision. He worked out how we could do self blinding. We couldn't, we were four years ago we had ethical permission to do a micro dosing study. So micro dosing for the, for the listeners, micro dosing is giving a sub psychedelic dose in fact really is, it should be a sub detectable dose. But some people do finally get some some small sense of alteration of consciousness or mood with it. So it's a very low dose and definitely a non psychedelic dose. And you take it usually there's a sort of regime you know, three or four days a week, a few days off. So, but no one's ever studied. We had permission four years ago to do an LSD micro dose and study. But the hospital and ethics committee said every single micro dose had to be given in hospital and people had to stay in for a whole day because the half life of LSD is like six hours and that was just too expensive. We could not afford to do it because of the controls. You know the fact that this is a Schedule One drug. So we went out in the community and we asked people who were actually micro dozing and we gave them envelopes so they could randomize between placebo hubs and and an LSD tabs. And and then and we collected the data and it turned out that About 90% of the effect of a micro doses what is expectation is zero. Now that's to my mind that's not you know that's fine. If you if you feel better taking placebo you know the adverse effects are likely to be pretty low. So that's fine by me but it encourages me and what we're doing which is using big bigger doses, it's single big doses to produce profound reframing of mental states. That's the way forward.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \"So when we think about micro dozing, you mentioned the doses of psilocybin sort of one mg 10 mg 25 mg where would micro dose fit in one?\":(\"It will be between one and 3.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" So yeah I guess we're for anyone who's you know, you know tried to publish, we yeah, absolutely. I think it it takes a long time um with L. S. D. D. M. T. And sort of masculine. You did talk about Ayahuasca as well. So do these differ in terms of mechanisms or are there any sort of differences between the psilocybin aspects? Could psilocybin be interchangeably used with L. S. D. D. M. T, masculine.\":(\" Really important. They differ obviously they differ in terms of potency so it is really important that you understand the dose of what you're taking because LSD is said it's about 1000 times more potent than masculine. So you don't want to mess with that. Make sure you get a decimal point in the right place. That's the first thing. They all work through the two way receptor but they all have different interactions with other receptors which is why some of them. So for instance the mescal in causes a lot of vomiting whereas LSD doesn't. So we don't fully understand why that is. And the key difference though is in terms of the half life and that's the reason actually why we, one of the reasons we pioneered our research with psilocybin. You take it already. This is a 3-4 hour trip. It's very you know we know it's very safe millions and millions of people in youngsters in Britain were using the mushrooms and For decades and we know that you know there's no death. So we know it's very safe and same with LSD is very safe but then an LSD trip lasts for 12 to 15 hours which means for research purposes you have to keep people in the hospital overnight which means that that triples the expense and also for clinical practice that will triple the expense. So so psilocybin is much shorter acting in S. T. D. M. T. Is really short acting. So if you know in our scientific studies of D. M. T. We give it intravenously and I think you can probably give it intra muscular as well. So that's a shot. And people have a powerful transient trip which lasts about 10 - 15 minutes and then they come back. So and there was a very interesting scientific question now you know some people are saying well that's all you need if you're gonna just shake up the brain to get rid of depression maybe that's all you need. Just shake the shake up the snow globe and it will settle down in a different way. That may be true. I mean, if it is true, that's interesting. My own view is that it's probable That the longer trip for 2-3 hour trips inside of side and are going to be more useful to depress people because basically it's not about shaking up the brain, it's about getting into the brain processes of depression while the brain is shaken up. And that that's why we we now call this therapy psychedelic psychotherapy, because everything we do is done with the ambition of the person coming out of the trip and then engaging in psychotherapy. And so I and I find this really exciting because, you know, this is bringing together sort of cutting edge psychopharmacology with the potential for innovation in psychotherapy. And you know, I'm really keen that the two are two disciplines which often are fighting each other, can actually come back and start holding hands. Hmm.\",\"goal\"),\n",
        "                                          \"So when we think about psychedelic psychotherapy, what would a session actually look like if I were to sort of enter into session? What would the duration look like, What would the actual session look like?\":(\" So, yeah, really important. Let me explain the process that we are using in our clinical trials. So which is likely to be pretty similar to what ends up in clinical practice. And there are four key elements. The first is what we call the preparation session. So you have to explain to people what's gonna go on in the trip because most of them haven't had a trip and you have to reassure them that even if they feel they're going mad, they're not and that there will always be a therapist present and help them work out how best to deal with what are often very negative experiences. I just let me just dispel one myth. One of my senior colleagues said to me once, well, of course these people are getting over the depression. They're just having a fun trip. I said the trip might have been fun for you when you were young, but for these depressed people who've been, you know, often been traumatized and suffered for decades. The trip is not fun. It's a really hard thing to do. They're often they're often reliving, they do, they relive their trauma, they they come and so it's it's hours of really difficult psychological experiences. It's not fun at all. So that's and in the trip we don't do any psychotherapy. Were there were present if they need to talk if they want to talk if they want to have hands held, you know, they're very frightened. You know, we we we nurture them comfort them, you know, but we don't ever try to engage with them because, you know, we, even in our volunteer studies, we had this, you know, you say to them, okay now it's for two hours into your trip, will you please do this test. And one guy said, oh fuck off, I'm talking to God, you know, and you know, the point is, you know, when people that they are beyond anything that's relevant, you know, they don't care about whether you can seriously subtract seven. You know, I mean it's a different dimension of consciousness so we don't ever engaged because we don't know what we're going to get back. But you could actually just destroy. The person. Could be at the point of that insight and destroyed. So we never but after the trip we obviously reassure them and then the next day we have what's called an integration session and that's where they talk through with their therapists. Usually we have to but maybe you could do it with one, they talk through for several hours, the experience and then the therapist guides them to see what meaning there is in that and what learnings there are. And while insights there have been and in that process, in an ideal world that would have you go, you'd continue then for say six or eight weeks psychotherapy each week looking at those issues and trying to then use other, you know, whatever psychotherapeutic approach you're familiar or skill that to improve the long term outcomes in practice for the clinical trials, we can't do that. But but in clinical practice I think we will be able to get even better outcomes by that long term follow up psychotherapy.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \"Right? So I guess,\":(\" hang on, let me I want to qualify this, that the immediate benefit comes. So with the second trip with the taliban comparison, it may be we've got a floor effect. So the reason we did the second trip three weeks, the first was actually not necessary to get a better outcome because that's difficult when you've got a good outcome already. But to see if we could prolong the benefit that data, we're still collecting that data, We haven't got that data.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" So when we're thinking about we've talked quite a bit about the psychedelic psilocybin. LSD. D. M. T. And fascinating stuff. M. D. M. A. I remember you talked about it when you come down to Australia to two years ago and you've previously talked about it as well. So M. D. M. A. From my understanding doesn't fit the description of a typical psychedelic but are showing quite a lot of promise within in psychiatry as well. Could you expand a bit on that?\":(\" Yes please. Um As you probably know, last week we published our first, the first ever study of M. D. M. A. In alcohol use disorder. And we showed again an open trial but to M. D. M. A. Sessions 125 mg two weeks apart as part of abstinence based alcohol therapy had an outcome which was infinitely better than our current therapeutic model. So with our current psychotherapy model, 80% relapse in six months. Just those two M. D. M. A. Sessions just inserted into the therapeutic model 20% relapse in six months. So this is a, you know, this is a remarkable, remarkable effect and why did we do it? Well, we did it for the same reason interestingly as we we did the psilocybin in depression. We did brain imaging studies. They showed what you pointed out already that M. D. M. A. Is not remotely like psychedelics, it doesn't change the cortical function the way the psychedelics does. But what it does do very powerfully suppressed the amygdala and the hippocampus. And we thought well that is why it's being used in PTSD because as you know, I'm sure all the psychiatrists listen to this know that the current preferred therapy of PTSD if if it doesn't respond to accessorize the therapy is exposure therapy It's prolonged effectively two or three hour exposure therapy allowing the patient to exhaust the emotion so that eventually the emotional resurgence which comes with the memory eventually extinguishes. And so it no longer perturbed their life. But many people cannot sustain that. And I started working on PTSD 1989. The reason I did that we did we did we started researching a a new tool for continuous noninvasive blood pressure monitoring. That was a level of our ability to monitor things in those days. And we started putting PTSD patients through it. And we discovered extraordinary instantaneous perturbations of blood pressure when they started to remember. And in those experiments we found people, you know, they were dissociated, faint or they just run out the room, you couldn't engage them in the therapy because the emotions just were so overwhelming and they were physiologically destructive. So you know, fast forward 30 years. We do you know we can see that M. d. m. a dampens down those reasons. So we thought well that explains why M. D. M. A. Works in PTSD. And then Ben caesar, who is a colleague of mine who who was a child psychiatrist and then he got disillusioned with that and moved into adult addiction psychiatry. He always said isn't it bizarre? You know I'm treating these abused kids and I'm loving them and we're all looking nurturing them as soon as they become adolescents, we put him in prison for being misbehaving misbehaving. You know this is wrong and he's right, it is wrong. Many, many alcoholics turn to alcohol to deal with trauma. So he said, well look why don't we deal with the trauma with M. D. M. A. And maybe they'll stop drinking. And that was what we did. And it was remarkable and now we're, you know, we're setting up a controlled trial to try to show that that was a real M. D. M. A. Effect and not just a kind of a prolonged exposure effect under M. D. M. A. Independent.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" So with so M. D. M. A. P. T. S. D. Is well known. But for those listeners and viewers that aren't aware of the effect. Could you, could you expand on, you know, what is the actual effect with PTSD in terms of efficacy?\":(\" Well again this goes back to the classic work of the mithoff. They've done two trials now to controlled trials. You take people with PTSD, the first trial was resistant. PTSD, they failed on at least ss arise, they failed on CBT, They put them through a classical PTSD, you know psychotherapy program. I think there's was 18 weeks, 18 sessions talking about the trauma helping them to reframe their life etc etc. But twice in the middle of those, Those 18 weeks they gave them A single dose, the same dose is 25 mg of m. d. m. a. And during the trip they made them relive the trauma so that the emotions started to come back and they discovered that you could extinguish the emotions much better under M. M. D. M. A. So that after the trip they didn't have the flashbacks. They didn't have the the conditioned emotional reflexes which are the I mean the core problem of PTSD is not the fact that you had their legs blown off. You know it's a fact that every time anything not anyone makes a noise bangs the door you feel that you're being blown up again. And the emotions of that you actually believe you're in the instance of the explosion again and that is totally destructive to anyone's life. So extinguishing the emotional reflexes, Extinguishing those, those unwanted perturbations of consciousness is the critical solution. You never forget the trauma, but you can at least suppress the emotions it damage you.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" Right? So if we think about, you know, there's lots of promising research, what's stopping this from sort of becoming mainstream.\":(\" Well they're all these drugs LSD psilocybin, ayahuasca and M. D. M. A. They're all illegal in all Western countries. So this research has been enormously difficult. It costs 10 times what it would cost in a sane world to do this research because of all the constraints I had to have a special safe to put my psilocybin with a camera making sure that when I take it out I don't slip it in my pocket and I say to the regulators, well why can't I just store it alongside the heroin I used for my other research. And they say, well, that's because heroin is a Schedule two drugs and this is a Schedule One drug. And I say, look, the reason I'm storing it is what people stealing it. If anyone breaks in, they're gonna steal the heroin, they're gonna steal the side of Simon. Come on. But the regulations have created this kind of monstrosity of bureaucracy, which is, You know, that's why virtually no one has done any research on these drugs for 50 years, because it's just too tedious and too difficult. And you gotta be you gotta be you gotta anticipate living a long time and be bloody minded like me to persevere with it. So we've got to try to change the rules. You know, the regulations serve no purpose. They don't protect people against recreational use. All they do is deny access of patients to this therapy.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" Right? Yeah. So I guess the big question, I'm sure everyone's thinking is we've talked about the efficacy clearly very, very promising research side effects adverse effects. So, if we we, you know, the traditional sort of psychedelic aspect is these experiences, some of them sound like psychotic experiences. So the question is, what is the potential for adverse effects and in your experience, what have you noticed?\":(\" So yes, I can answer that in two ways. I can answer that from my experience, which is we don't ever put anyone into these trials who has been psychotic or who has a first degree relative who is psychotic or has been. And therefore we have seen no psychotic reactions And we've practiced. We've seen basically when you see the paper that's coming out in a few months you'll see apart from the trip itself which is there's a big debate is the experience of the trip an adverse effect or not. I mean I kind of say well of course it's not. You know. But then you know you could argue it well it might be. So anyway we report those. But after the trip you know there's no side effects. And that's one of the reasons many patients are looking for this therapy because they don't want to be on a daily dose of something which might affect their sexual function or increased weight or something. So so but we but much better than my experience. We go back to history. We can go back to uh the when these drugs were banned in 19 in the late 60s and the US and the U.N. the psychiatrists were very upset because they've done lots of work and many psychiatrists thought these were revolution treat. So there were analyses of thousands and thousands of treatments. And if you look at remarkable you know the rates of psychosis were lower. And you predict from normal therapy the rates of suicide were lower than you'd predict. And there were virtually no other adverse effects. So the evidence that these drugs are harmful when used in therapy very intermittently. You know, maybe twice in a lifetime. You know, the evidence of harm is that it's not there.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" Right. So, so generally when we so I'm just sort of thinking in the future, if you know, a psychiatrist were to prescribe sort of psychedelic psychotherapy at some point, as we do with CSS RSR SnR, as we generally advise them of the potential for, you know, to take them regular withdrawal, sexual dysfunction at Kathy's emotional blunting etcetera etcetera. So, so what would be the top five or three side effects generally one would mention in psychedelic psychotherapy for patients that are undergoing therapy?\":(\" No, it's only the experience, only the experience of the only anything that lasts beyond the experience headaches. So quite a few people get headaches overnight and the next day they're kind of actually, that is quite an important point. Me groaners may get worse headaches, but you can use these drugs to treat severe migraines, like cluster headaches. So there's a paradox here and we don't it's that's probably got something to do with this desensitization that I talked about before. But in terms truly the only adverse effect that endures beyond the trip headaches. So you just warn people about that and you can take a couple of paracetamol,\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \"right. Um I remember sort of seeing. Um and this is one or two patients, I remember as a registrar um individuals that were using recreational drugs quite a lot, particularly ecstasy LSD um and magic mushrooms. And I remember these cases, two cases of persistent the realization depersonalization. Is is that something that, you know, is a potential risk? Or\":(  \" of course it's a potential risk? Absolutely, yeah. I mean, it is a potential risk, but I say everything is mitigated by the way we do it, but we know what we're doing, we know what does we're giving. We've got therapist presence. So, I mean, yes, you know, d realization depersonalization often associated with anxiety disorders and in some ways they are an anxiety disorder. And that's why we say, never don't go out into the Bush and take these drugs. You know, you know, we were looking at this is medical therapies, like the same way as you say, well, you wouldn't encourage someone to go out in the bush and start taking opium to deal with their pain. You know, you you this is we're looking at therapy, powerful therapy, recreational use, I wouldn't encourage because of the potential homes. But you know, that that we shouldn't be banning, we shouldn't be trying to eliminate recreational use by banning medical use. That's all I would say\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                           \" is there is there a risk? Or do you foresee or I guess, you know, the government's um I wonder whether they sort of are particularly worried about this aspect is, you know, is it possible that the approval of psychedelics for medical purposes? Is it possible that that actually leads to an increase in casual recreational use? Because kind of people kind of go, well it's for treatment therefore, you know, I guess we could use lots more of it. I wonder,\":(\" well all I can say the best example we have, where that hasn't happened is cannabis. You know, I mean medical cannabis hasn't led to a recreation. I mean of course there is a worse example I suppose which is previous medical use of opiates in America. But you know the american medical systems can predispose to problems. But cannabis and opiates are different from psychedelics as you take them every day. So there is a scope for diversion. No one is going to be taking home a psilocybin tablets. They cannot there won't be diversion. And that means it's very very unlikely that there's going to be any slippage from medical prescribing into recreation?\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                           \" Right? And then\":(\"All the research was done on LSD tablets. 25\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                           \" right. So I guess if we were to think about like with any innovation, we've got, I think with technology, they often talk about this innovation graph, you know, the innovation trigger the peak of inflated expectations, then we've got the trough of disillusionment, the slope of enlightenment and the plateau of productivity. Where would you put psychedelics on that graph for you know, currently, where would you put it?\":(\" So that's a really lovely question. So me, in my research, we're definitely on the upward curve. If you look at investors, they're way ahead. There's an absurd, absurd amount of hype about psychedelic therapy. I mean, all the money that in the States and Canada that has been made of the cannabis boom is now moving. So, you know, I'm I'm kind of hesitant about this massive enthusiasm for for psychedelics as a as a way of making money. But I think certainly were on the rising phase of them as being a therapy,\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                           \" right? Yeah. You mentioned cost is a big barrier. So what could you give us an idea about\":(\" sex? It's not going to be a barrier to a rich country like Australia. That's no barrier in Britain. I mean that's the only poor countries,\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                           \"Right. Right. So if I had to you know, sort of if we had to sort of predict or foresee when do you think psychiatrists potentially might be in the position um of actually prescribing psychedelic psychotherapy?\":(\" Well that'll be quite soon. The bigger challenge it is going to be what the challenge we have met in your country and in my country with medical cannabis, it's not that the drug it's not the medicines work but doctors won't prescribe because doctors aren't educated, doctors don't like the idea that these things have come up in a different way from patients often. So the biggest limitation is going to be dr education which actually I think is why this interview you've just done is spectacular because we've gone through everything all the issues that doctors confront me with when they're trying to find reasons not to think positively about this treatment but its medical education and and psychologist I think even a bigger I think psychiatrists probably gonna be more open minded. But as you know psychologists often get stuck into therapeutic ruts. You know the big battle between CBT therapist and behavior. It's the same thing but they spent 30 years arguing with it. You know we need to get psychologists interested because optimizing the psychology is gonna be harder than optimizing the pharmacology. We've almost kind of optimist that already now so we need psychologists optimizing the therapeutic interventions that they give plump.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                           \" Okay so I guess we're coming to the to the end of the interview. This has been absolutely fascinating. Um I'd like to sort of end with you know what would be your three most important points? Of course you can give us more. But what would be the three most important take home message is for psychiatrist and mental health professionals when it comes to you know psychedelic psychotherapy or psychedelics and psychiatry mm.\":(\" Well the first is that certainly psilocybin and M. D. M. A. Are going to be proven therapies in psychiatry within a few years. That's the first point. The second point is I believe they're going to revolutionize many aspects of psychiatry and I hope psychiatry will embrace them because if it doesn't then we're going to go through this period of years, maybe decades where patients suffer. Let me let me give you a little um some I've done a little bit of arithmetic before LSD was banned in 1967 in America. The U. S. Government had funded six trials of LSD one or two doses for alcoholism recently. Some Norwegians reviewed in a meta analysis of that data and they came up with an effect size of one. So it's twice 2.5 times that of a campus eight. So this is the biggest effect size ever seen in alcoholism now in the 50 odd years. It's it's that these drugs have been banned. I've estimated over 100 million people worldwide have died prematurely from alcohol misuse If LSD only helped 10% of them. That's 10 million lives premature death saved. That's the kind of number that psychiatrists should be thinking about. The opportunities for these drugs to change the whole life trajectory of patients is enormous and but it won't happen unless psychiatrists get interested in it and at least try it out. Yeah.\",\"Reality-other\")\n",

So I was just really keen and then basically a lot of things happened where a lot of things came together, where I kind of, I was working for my levels and then that was stopped and um I was kind of not doing much like waiting for my gap year to start. Um and I was a little bit of an idiot and I kind of thought I deferred my place to university and I hadn't and I realized that about I realized that when they rang me in fresh this week and said, why haven't you registered? So I kind of ended up with like, no university place. Yeah. Um so a lot of things happened and, you know, my my partner now wife, I went to university, I end up following her to Dublin, but she'd gone off, so it's just massive life changes. And it I just, basically I had this, I mean, it feels like it has a very quickly, but when you look back there are a lot of warning signs for a few weeks that I wasn't quite right. Um had a really exciting gig in a band I was in and I was lots of ideas and energy, but it really kind of came to a head where I had saved up some money just kind of working a job doing breakfast shift in the hotel. And I went to a friends who had loads of this because I've always been a bit musical and he had loads of musical equipment loaded like recording and sense and stuff and I remember we just make music, I've got a few 100 quid saved, maybe I could buy this. And literally over the course of that night it went from, I'm gonna buy myself a bit of recording equipment for my computer to, I'm going to set up an international business empire with like a recording studio and restaurants and bars linked and it's going to be international. And I mean those days are a bit of a blur, but I know that I met people if I hadn't seen from school, I hadn't seen for a while, they were going to be my executive, something was offering people on the street a job I rang up, the bank was trying to speak to them about alone, luckily I, I was put in hospital before I actually had that meeting. Um, yeah, I just, it's completely escalated and you know, it was really just intense, kind of didn't sleep. So my family ended up, my parents going to realize something was wrong. So I ended up kind of getting, yeah, taken into hospital really. Um, his actions, but, you know, I could have been, if I hadn't have gone willingly, but still, it was very much like I was there still writing out my business plans and all of this stuff. It didn't the penny didn't drop for a long, long time. So I was really, you know, manic, I was in hospital when unfortunate, that's the only time I've been in the hospital. Um you know, my my partner came over and fresh this week and um it was really difficult. My so called the teachers that you just pack him to visit me in the world. Um I was kind of their go really interested in. I saw a clinical psychologist when I was discharged, which was really helpful trying to make sense of what happened. Um So it took a good few months to cover. I ended up having my gap here. Um I kind of thought it was a one off really. Um So I went to university in Dublin and I started and it was all going well and I found my love and I embraced my g side psychology and then kind of in there was one point where I felt like I was taking on too much and I felt a little bit like my mind was racing and I remember just speaking to one of the doctors but it was okay. I was really into my final year when things really escalated and again, a trigger for me with lots of life changes and boredom. So I've been doing loads and loads of, I've been working as a support worker and getting my station up and running and research system and lots of stuff um tendency to buy more than I can chew. Um and then that all stops and things really calmed down and I started my mind started racing. I had loads of energy again. And yeah, the irony, this is why I start talking about how it relates to my career. Um I got I literally got some hyper manic about my dissertation about hyper main. Yeah.\":(\" Yeah,\", \"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" I really did. Um remember my supervisor, this is a really niche topic he's got here uh interesting and I haven't really told anyone at that point, you know, my close friends knew and my my my family knew but I wasn't so I told some people I wasn't too open about it. It's kind of neat to know that that was the first time I really thought God this might actually be this isn't a one off is it? And at that point I saw a psychiatrist and they were like, you know, you've had to Manic episodes. So you know we'd say you're bipolar. Now, looking back, I definitely had one when I was 16 as well. Um It just wasn't picked up at the time, you know how festival had this ridiculous business idea and didn't sleep and I injured myself but I was still, You know at a festival. He was yeah, so in retrospect, it's definitely been there since about the age of 16. Um So yeah, it kind of was on medication, it kind of settled down a little bit and now I graduated started my assistant. So I called this job um ironically my first kind of supervisor when I was a research system, uh knew my parents. Um He's a clinical psychologist and he knew my parents and he was actually at my mom's 50th birthday party when I was on leave in the psychiatric ward to go to my mom's 50th. Um So I remember seeing him and I was you know, I was really not, well they let me go out for a few hours which was really kind of them but I was you know, still really high as a coat and I remember him saying how you're doing and everything and he was my supervisor and we never mentioned it, I never thought about it and I look back now and I go that's strange. I remember even we were away for like a conference and they were saying something, there was four of us sitting around the table and someone said something about one in four people apparently has a mental health problem. I was just like going this is my moment, say it, don't say it, don't say no what if he was back? Um I never discussed it with him, which seems a bit strange. Um But yeah, so I was kind of the game carried on my career towards um clinical psychology and I started being interested in bipolar disorder and doing little bits of research and publishing bits kind of about bipolar disorder, hyper mania, that kind of thing. Um And interestingly, throughout my career it's not been the big life events like getting married and having Children, having made me unwell, it's very much life events related to my career, really push on that failure, but um you know, not good enough, those are the ones that seem to get me. So, it's very much related to my career, like I was saying, so dramatic about Romania. Um when I was on the doctor, a big trigger for me becoming quite kind of like, a bit of a mixed episode I'd call, it was, you know, I was proud research geek, and wanted to do research as part of my career, and we had a research project and every project and I failed it. Um It was really starting to the system, so I was like, oh God, I thought I was good at this and, you know, you end up doubting yourself and no one thought I'm not good enough, and that was kind of a bit of a, a bit of a trigger there, I ended up going to the GP um there was probably times I should have got help. Seem to be honest, no time tomorrow is really so unwell. I don't think I should have been working, but I should have reached out for help before, But I kind of, I kind of floated under secondary mental health services, you know, because I was under them when I was 18, but then at university it was in another country, so it was all done through the university and then you know when I was an assistant a research system. My Gp was also a psychiatrist. So he just kind of took care of me. So I kind of floated very much below if that makes sense. But I probably should have more help earlier but I was just really worried about what would happen what would happen if I love you know you especially when you're on the doctor because it's okay very intense you know you get someone who literally parcel fail replacement. You're being constantly evaluated. So I was really I honestly was catastrophizing fears. Catastrophizing. Now at the time I didn't know what was going to happen. Am I gonna take the same fits practice automatically. So I even go into my G. P. I was really anxious about not being told. Um And it really stopped me getting help when you know when I should have. Um So I think about halfway through the doctor I ended up telling my tutor and the head of the doctor and they were really nice really supportive and not actually very surprised to be quite honest\":(\" really.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" Yeah they kind of said they said oh you you have a lot of ideas and you always taken on a lot and publishing stuff and this makes sense now it's kinda makes sense. Um But the way they put it which is always really nice to bear in mind was you know you know what sets you off and you know kind of what happens and becoming well so actually from where we're sitting that's really helpful you know? Um So that was really good, it was like a big kind of release and I told her I told a handful of people I was close to in my training cohort. Um uh So that was nice but I would say about that. I had never told anyone in placement until my very last one. Um and this is my last placement so I was kind of like 27 then um I never had depression, I just had kind of hyper manic manic episodes. Um And I have this kind of I think quite hyper manic again career hyper manic writing speed of my dissertation where I just wrote um you know I really was just productive and just wrote a lot and in retrospect maybe I was a little bit manic and then I handed it in and I just crashed and I was in supervision and I just kind of ended up crying and I told my supervisor then what happened is that you know the context but I didn't know I was depressed. I don't know I didn't I didn't realize it even though like final year special interest in my final year trainee, I didn't realize I was depressed until I was really quite deep in it, you know I didn't quite grasp what was going on. Um So I ended up saying to my supervisor, not in the best way, maybe it wasn't a planned thing, but you know, she needed to know um in retrospect, maybe I should have taken a few weeks off, but at the time it was again, what's going to happen? I'm not gonna qualifying time catastrophizing, catastrophizing. Um So yeah, that was that was really that was a difficult placement. Um but I kind of my I ended up coming out the other side and the university organized me some kind of remote therapy with one of the other insights on another course in the country, which was very useful just to kind of understand a little bit more about why have been set off on my warning signs, which is really helpful and\":(\" we spoke about before and when we were talking about some of the feelings that kind of raised in you to be a trainee clinical psychologist at that time, experiencing a mental health difficulty and are I found a real resonance with my experience as well and other peoples that I've heard around ideas of shame in there, the real anxiety,\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" thinking about, okay, you can special interests. Remember telling a colleague before, and she was like uh huh. Yeah, I did wonder about your special interest. You always wonder when someone has a special interest. So, yeah, you know, again, I remember this same colleague before I told her because I was qualified, she said to me, so it was just something like you, how do you get all these ideas and have this much energy and I'm just gonna make a joke. And I remember someone going tom like, what are you on? And I was just like, you know, just like into the coffee, that's all I need, that kind of thing jokingly obviously. And then when I was more open to tell them that the context, but there's a reason we go into it and sometimes it's our own experiences. Sometimes it's, you know, loved ones who have had these problems you're saying. I think I really like being interested in bipolar disorder and having that experience. And um of course it's not essential. I just think it gives me a different perspective, you know, kind of like say to people, you know, I'm interested in my post order as a researcher and as a clinician and as a service user triples that. Um and of course it's not essential, but it does give me a different perspective because sometimes the research ideas I have start with something I've noticed in my own kind of experience, and then I look at the literature and I go maybe that's so a lot I've done is around bipolar disorder and financial difficulties and impulse spending, and that's very much came from my own um it kind of evolved out of my dissertation which was about student tuition fees and mental health, but then I was thinking about when I was manic, I impulsively spent um to buy furniture for this recording studio is going to have and all of this stuff, and random, massive djembe african drums and all this stuff, and I was like, there's not much written about this, even though people say when you manage you spend spend spend, no one's thinking about why this is so that's definitely fueled my interest there. And I think most of the time it's helpful. There are times when it it's really hard though, I'm like, when I was on my final placement and I was in an inpatient ward and, you know, when people are really pretty hopeless and suicidal and you're feeling really hopeless, it's quite hard, you know, it is, it's harder to kind of resilience goes down and, you know, there's times when someone goes out and everything's just really crap and if you're really down, it's kind of, it is, you know, you kind of thinking in your mind, you almost say that to yourself um\":(\"what helped? Um\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" and I didn't I didn't say anything. I thought maybe she doesn't know me in that way. But in the end I just thought, no, I'm not being honest here. I told occupational health and everyone, you know, but I told him he basically just like, I think most people are going to what you're doing have their own reasons for it and I'm glad you could be here. So that was really nice and I do sometimes tell service users, but I always do it very think very carefully about it. Um I do it, you've got to make sure that it's it's for them, not for you, you know. Um but there have been some patients when people it's really hard to connect with someone or they're kind of just really hope that you don't get it. And there have been times when I have said, you know I do and I do really think about it carefully and I always take it to supervision and that's really helped. There have been other times when patience was running out. I like to think I don't because I was actually unwell at the time and they were worried about me but I was running a bipolar group and when people said tom All of our thinking is this is like 10 people in the room. So kind of all over the place and wacky center. You just get it, you're not bipolar are you? And everyone laughed and I just kind of awkwardly laughed so I didn't want to lie but I didn't think that was the best time to say yes. Um And then when I saw her 1-1 a few weeks later I did say yeah that was\":(\"the case, yes, that's\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" yeah, kind of because you wanted to be like, look at me, I thought I'm not gonna go out and I'm not going to do this talk, thinking I'm going to say it, but if it comes up, I'm gonna say it, you know, so I was kind of giving myself the option. Um So I went through, I talked about this formulation initial manic episode and the stuff I've talked to you about losing place at university and this stuff. Um And then at the end, any questions. And one of my colleagues just went, that guy you were talking about, how are you doing now? I was like, well that's an interesting point. So I told them all, and it was really liberating, and then I put a big thing on facebook where I was friends with lots of people from work just saying about it, and it was a really nice reaction because, you know, I told a couple of people before, you know, who had kind of maybe something out and that felt quite nice, but it was like a I share a little secret, you know, it shouldn't be like that, but when I did just completing so come out with people really nice because they were just like, oh my God, I wouldn't have guessed. Um and that makes sense while you're interested in this stuff where you're interested in why this is a special interest and then a lot of people think about their own struggles as well, you know,\":(\"Which they\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" didn't feel like they could talk about now that I'm in a place where I am open about it and everyone knows people have said to me, are you okay tom I have noticed, you know, seems like your mind's racing a bit and a little bit on the go today, are you okay? Much better for keeping myself? Well, because the problem is when you keep it all locked up and all that kind of shame, like it's a dirty secret, you won't tell anyone until you really have to to the whole idea of prevention, early intervention becomes so much harder, you know? Um So it's it's nice that I can be open about it. Um and that my managers ask how are you doing and I can share my relapse prevention plan. Um So that that was really important kind of place to be and I think it was around that time I kind of started to notice myself coming up. Well it wasn't related to that, I remember remember timescales anyway around kind of a few years ago as well, I started to become unwell and I ended up going into secondary care for the first time since I was 18. Um so that was interesting as well because you know, it was I was a patient in the place where I've been on placement in a few years before and I knew some of the psychiatrists a little bit professionally from when I was on placement um and they noted that they're like, I know I know you're in another context, it's just okay. Yes it is. Um and they were really nice and I feel\":(\"like,\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" you know, I felt like I was taken care of and everyone's very compassionate and respectful and you know, I think in a good way, there was a bit of it one of our own, you know? Um But it did make me laugh as well, the psychiatrist said because I had kind of little bits of therapy, but not kind of fell on, the psychiatrist said, okay, so let me get this right, you know, so we've got medication. What about psychological therapy? And I said, yeah, I really I really appreciate that, I really find that helpful. Okay, so I'm gonna go to my clinical psychology colleagues and ask for someone to do for bipolar disorder with an expert in for bipolar disorder and they're going to love me.\":(\"Oh my goodness. So\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" yeah, it was it was a bit, it was a bit difficult because I it was like we had to go to a list of, do you know this person? Do you know this person? Yes. Yes, Yes. Um So I I ended up being assessed by someone who had kind of known a little bit from meetings and that was fine. Actually, I didn't mind after the first couple of times and then they ended up they ended up my the conscious saw um he's amazing. So I teach for the CBT bipolar story part of the CBT diploma. Um So I do the teaching for that. Um and I use my own experiences, I kind of do smash it with my own experiences. And the feedback I get is that's really helpful, which is really nice. But the first time I did that she was doing the diploma and then two years later she was my therapist. So basically like she learned how to do seem to for bipolar disorder from me and then we're trying to get him to do So\":(\"again,\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" got it and we work together. But coming from a different angle suggesting things in therapy that I wouldn't have thought of really useful, but it was kind of like starting formulation was like, why don't you go in and work in this formulation? Because I know you're really getting into it, okay, so I go and work and do lots of diagrams and arrows and then bring it back and okay, this is good, you know, so yeah, it worked well, but it was that was the first time I'd gone into kind of a proper period of therapy rather than kind of I've done bits and bobs like online therapy and a few sessions here. Few sessions are um really have life changed that whole the whole kind of motor of high standards, just slow down and all of this. I remember saying to when I was initially assessed now, I say all this part of me that, you know, more and more and more. Again, it's related to my career. I get manic about publishing stuff in my career and grants and all this stuff, you know, And I've become nearly unwell when I had good news about a research grant and it makes my head explode. So, it's kind of a very interesting relationship, but it really kind of wound that down and focusing on what really matters to me, my values rather than the highest achievement. Remember got really brought home to me when I said it was part of me that would just keep going more and more and more and it would never be enough. And she said, you know, it's not dissimilar to an anorexia way. It's like I'm going for this, wait. And then when you get to it, I'm going to go a bit lower, go a bit lower and, you know, it's that same kind of searching for a goal and you just move the goalposts. So it's just been so helpful too, really reevaluate my relationship with my career and not place as much emphasis on ticking boxes and reaching goals. But I don't think it's made me, made me anymore Unproductive. Remember saying, what's your fear about therapy and any worries. I'm worried that I'm going to get so relaxed, I'm just gonna not be bothered about my work anymore. You\":(\" know,\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" I believe myself, critical high standards. You sure when it's not? Um so now there are tons when I do find myself saying I'm not good enough and I've got to work harder and it's still something I live with. But that drive to kind of overachieve, which was a double edged sword in terms of my creative like, boom and bust, definitely. It's just wound down. I remember saying to her at the end, it's like I've I've been training my life to get an olympic gold in my career and I just realized I just like running doesn't really matter. That's\":(\"brilliant.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" like a running joke in our group. Like it's in the job description in the person's step for being a cleanse. Like is to like have a core belief that I'm a failure and then try to overcome it and say, but it's so you know, and it's it's so competitive to get into the doctor, isn't it? Um It just leads you to compare yourself to others and think I'm not good enough. I'm never going to get on and then the doctor is intense and you're constantly under a microscope. So yeah, I think there's a lot of people, I think, you know, we do have a lot of self critical thoughts and high standards in our profession and some people that, you know, clinical to the extent that it's a mental health problem. So um I think it's okay to own. Oh, slight perfectionist.\":(\" We try. I think we try. Yeah. It's the only important thing really to have spaces.

Getting away from the house is clearly one of the things um doing something where we can take the dog is another thing like I enjoy like getting out and taking the dog with us. He has fun, we have fun. It's doing things outside usually not shopping not that kind of stuff Like I don't I'm not a big shopper. Um But I do like to get out in nature and I like to whether it is like it's starting to get cold now so this probably isn't the right time for this but like you know um going out and going fly fishing or um going for hikes or as the weather starts to get colder, maybe really contemplating where we're gonna go snowshoeing. So we actually have a like we're thinking about that kind of stuff and it doesn't even have to be like overnight stuff. It could be, we live in a place that's super close to lots of outdoor activities. It's just that we actually have to get outdoors to do them.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" Yeah. So tell tell me a little bit more about the story you're telling yourself?\":(\" Well, I think, I mean, okay, so I can tell you my story, but my story is I do this because it's a way of spending time with Michael and it's really important to him that we do these chores like because because in his mind, they're not going away. So if we don't do them, then his list is just building, right? Um So I think that's my story about his story. My story about my story is I enjoy spending time with him and I enjoyed the projects also. And there's a sense of accomplishment when we can walk into our garage again, right? Or like we spent yesterday, like I vacuumed the whole entire garage that there's not a spiderweb. Well there may be one left, but you know what I mean? Like we cleaned out like the garage feels great to walk in right now. Um and we only have another six months of, you know, weekends that are probably required in order to get because we had both of our moms living with us. And then, um, so we have not just our stuff in our garage, but we also have two mothers stuff in the garage and his mom passed away. My mom's moved back to New Mexico, but there's some stuff that's just not going to be going anywhere. So I have to figure out what to do with it. And so, And lots of it needs to be shredded because it's things like taxes from 1997, you know what I mean? So, and and that stuff doesn't just happen by itself. Like you've got to actually go out there and shred it or hire somebody to come and shred it. Mm.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" Wow. Yeah, I totally, I totally understand and I totally get the whole idea of when you're spending so long with being responsible and caring and serving other people. Um when that shifts, it can be hard to shift your time spent as well, right? Yeah,\":(\" It's not quite like emptiness syndrome, but there elements of similarity. The difference is we didn't have to do it for 18 years, you know, and really great friends. So it isn't like we had disconnected along the way, right? Like we stayed connected. Um and yeah, well we've gotten disconnected from as a couple is the just the fun of just going out and having an adventure together on a regular basis and, and I think the reason it's coming up so strongly for me right now is that we finally, I really do have, my mom's been gone. We've had time, we're starting to do it. But then again, there's these agreements that we made that we're not taking action on like scuba diving. Um and I think it is for me committing because we're starting to have the conversations, but really committing to this idea of what will bring us reel every weekend. What will bring us joy and not throwing out, like, maybe what we really need to do, and this maybe is the conversation I need to be having with Michael is one day of each weekend is set aside for us. one day is set aside for chores, right? So, because those things have to be done, laundry has got to be done, houses gotta be clean, things like that. Um and one day is set aside to get in the car and go somewhere and do something for the Mhm. And we didn't do this this weekend. We spent saturday going into the olympic National Forest and we went, you know, hiking a little bit in the, like a hurricane ridge. And then we went down to the Elbe River where the baby salmon are spawning, well where the salmon has been spawning, there's all these little salmon that are, it was very cool, like along this river. So, um so we did it this weekend, so that's great. Um\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \"so, what, what supported you being able to do that this weekend? How did that happen this weekend?\":(\" I was like, we are leaving this house, where do you want to go? Like, where do you want to go? Because we're going? And I was throwing out some different ideas and he's like, that's too far, this is too far, let's do this. And so it's like, fine, let's do that. So that's what we did. Um and so I think it was, it was just determination.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \"Okay, so determination is a success factor. Um What was the effect of having that time away?\":(\" We had such a good time, you know, and you see things um you're looking at the, you're seeing new things with your eyes, aren't looking at the same things that you always look at, right? Um and so there was that novelty piece of, I've never been to any of these places that we went um they're so huge, we could go back to them over and over again and I would see something different every single time, right? So there's that um and and then coming home, we, you know, stopped at this really cool place and had this like awesome meal and a couple of local brews, you know what I mean? And it was just like this nice rounded out fun day which then led to sunday when we were cleaning in the garage. Um We had so much done, you know what I mean? So\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" Yeah. Okay. So you wanted to get to some action items and I've heard you talk about the conversation you want to have?\":(\" Yeah, those are really the action items. I think it's really the two conversations that, well the one conversation with the two parts um that I want to have with Michael about, you know, and we started this conversation because we were having it a bit on saturday about how nice it was to just be outside and you know, and exploring some areas we hadn't been before. Um He hadn't been to hurricane ridge since he was like seven. So yeah and and so that was a while ago um Without giving ages away or anything like that. Um Let's just say it was a while a long while ago. Um So we were starting that conversation but I think that other element of how we both sharpen our saws may be different and really having some clarity around. How do we honor that for both of ourselves? I think that's important and I think the I think the accountability piece, because I know I had mentioned something around accountability is comes out of that conversation right? So that he and I are like holding each other accountable and it isn't just me going let's go, let's go, let's go. But it's him going all right, this is the weekend, we these are the two weekends we agree this is one of our go away weekends, you know? And that way I don't feel like it's just me pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, get me the hell out of here, right? You know? But\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" right? Right. And what I'm hearing is that there's I'm actually hearing three things. There's you as an individual, your husband is an individual and you as a couple. Um for shopping for sharpening your saw. So there are three pizzas. Two.\":(\" Yeah that's a good insight I'm gonna write that down real quick. Yeah um attempted to write it in a text message so that I can just text it to him. Three areas for sharpening. Um Me, you us. Yeah and here's the deal to like I don't see him enough that I want like I mean that I really want to do something separate from him on the weekend. Like I find myself turning down things. Um That's on weekends because I don't get to see him enough as it is that I don't want to. Mhm. Have like oh I'm going out with girlfriends to go do X. Y. Z. I try and do that stuff during the week. Um So that on the weekend I can just really be present to hang out with him even though we're just hanging out at home watching a movie or\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \"So lisa what are your takeaways from our conversation today?\":(\" Well, I think my my biggest takeaway is just a like that awareness around the ways that we sharpen our saws may be different and to make sure that that element is addressed in the conversation so that it isn't something we're just sort of stepping over because we're not thinking about it or stepping over because I want to go out and do something because I've been at home all all week long. Um I think the other being that is the takeaway is just I mean, really just how much this is important to me and I believe it's also important to Michael. So, I don't feel like I'm alone in this um and this shifting and roles like, like this making the next step in the shift towards not being caretakers for our moms. You know, that we're really there, we have this opportunity. And I'll be honest with you, I didn't bring this up in the conversation, but this is something that's a takeaway because it's popping into my mind right now. Life is life is fragile and unpredictable. I do not want to waste the time that we have not. Mhm. Being in relationship to our lives the way that is meaningful to us,\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",

I\":(\" have a couple of issues that are top of mind right now for me. Um Okay, so, and I need a little help kind of navigating which one might be the most useful or anyway, let me just share them. So I'm leaving the board. I'm leaving the board and I am interested in continuing to volunteer with the board. And yet there's been some sense of maybe I should not volunteer with the board because I've been in a leadership position with the board, but to give space for new leaders to emerge. And, and I'm trying to sort of assess how I feel about that. Like, the conversation, I had a conversation this morning with president and I'm past president of this particular board and I'm looking at just wanting to help kind of behind the scenes with the website. It's not like I want to have a leadership position. Um, but the sense was that, You know, maybe I need to because I've been so president on the board since 2000 And really started playing with the board in 2005, and then really in leadership since 2006, 2005, 2015. and 2016, I've been in leadership that people just default to going to me. Yeah. And um, and so maybe stepping off and not having anything to do with the board would allow other people to move forward on in leadership. And so there's a part of me that I and I had the conversation where I said, you know, I'm really feeling like I'm being pushed out When I'd still like to volunteer. I mean, and I've had a volunteer job since I was 12 and II love the board that I'm on. So there's a piece of me that is like\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",

I\":(\" honestly think that a useful outcome for me would be to have a sense of how I want to move forward. And if I'm not going to stay with the board or help, like if I'm not, if I'm gonna, if I'm gonna choose to step away entirely and that isn't necessarily the only option. But if I were to choose to do that, What else would I mean? I've had a volunteer job since I was 12. Ah, what do I do? Right. What do I, what do I, what do I want to put my energy into that's volunteer if I'm not doing it with this organization. So\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",

I kind of go in and I try on different ideas like coats and I kind of look in a mirror in my head of does this code even fit? Does it look good? Like is this really the coat I want or, and then I take it off and I put on a different code and I kind of go through the same thing and I kind of try different things on sort of in a mental mirror. Um before I then test the waters more deeply than that. And honestly, as you say that the thing that's really coming to into my mind is that because because I had really considered staying on with this board as a volunteer, not on the board itself, but is it just a volunteer within the organization. I hadn't really thought about any other coats. I might try on, right,\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",

So many of those coats, what would that look like for you now?\":(\" So the thing that that I'm thinking is I actually really have not done as much with animals in a long time is I did when I was younger and when I was younger I volunteered what was then the Steinhart aquarium and it was great. I loved it. I mean it was so much fun and I like, I love animals and and I'm just even curious like with the like there's wildlife rescue in the area that I live, there's um I think that I think that if I were to be thinking about a section of the wardrobe, it would be a section having to do with animals because I've worked so extensively with people Since I've been in it like since about 18 because I started working with rape crisis and I was a hospital advocate and I was going into the hospital and then just really unreasonable for me here where I live because it takes me 45 minutes to get to a hospital to up to two hours. So That's just not gonna happen. And I and honestly, I don't really want to do crisis intervention since I spent the last 20 years being a therapist doing a lot of crisis intervention, it just feels like more like work. Um So I really think if I were to look at a section of my wardrobe, it would be a section around animals.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",

I think it's the expansion of our heart. It's the expansion of it's, it's the expansion of awareness that these are living creatures who are having a life experience and in any way we can make it less shitty. Um that would be a kindness and I think that the world is in dire need of more compassion and kindness and so that for me is really the linkage. Yeah, I think that's really, I think that's a big piece of that for me and I know I know I can feel it's true because I can just feel it sitting here in my chest and in my throat that this is really important to me.

        "                                           \"and how might you start that process?\":(\" Well, I mean, I think what I mean, I think that part is really kind of going to be easy. I think it comes down to um, looking at some of the organizations that are here locally on where I live in Washington, um, state where I want to clarify that in Washington state, um, where I live. Um, and And looking at what is just immediately within, you know, a 10-15 mile radius of where I live to start seeing. I know we have like a wildlife rescue. I know there's other rescue organizations in the area that I could drive to. Um, if I were to go and do like into an office and be of service in that way or working with the animals themselves. Um, and then expanding out from there. If I don't find something that really resonates for me to some of the larger organizations that, you know, best friends or some of those other larger rescue organizations.

You're not quite often, but what might you bring from that experience as a skill set that might support this new volunteerism category?\":(\" Well, one of the things that's been most beneficial about the last experience that I've had is I have learned how to wear pretty much every hat in the organization from president to rolling out an entire virtual learning platform to finding speakers to do like virtual learning. But I mean I also do podcasting. So I mean there's like all this other stuff that I can do. Um, and like helping, like helping some organ, like there's all these different things that I've learned how to do in the last, You know, 20 years of my life of creating businesses and business management and working with boards and organizations. Plus there's coaching in and of itself within an organization that's a volunteer organization, uh, to, to the fundamentals of like just being in the back and helping maintain a web page or a website, right? Like I'm not attached to it being in the front of the room. I'm more attached to being a service. So I think, I mean that's the piece that I think there's probably many different places where I could play.

She's coached and trained leaders in 36 countries and presented at the Harvard Kennedy School, Cornell University and Smith College, among others. She was actually one of the 1st 25 people to earn the Master certified coach designation and was the fifth global president of the I. C. F. And currently sits on the board. She was recognized in 2018 by global gurus as the number five coach in the world. So congratulations on that Marcia and a fun fact from Marcia today she is wearing the shirt that she wore when she did her ted X, how to handle Precocious women at the Perryville Women's correctional prison and then we have Christine mullen joining us from Auckland. So welcome and thank you for joining us. her background is in change management and H. R. And she's currently evolving and refining what she enjoys and studying career development. She has been coached before but never by Marcia. So this is her first session ever with Marcia and a fun fact from her today. She is a farm girl at heart, living in the city with her kitty and her man and is going to be visiting the family farm in a month to go play with some baby cows and get her country fixed on and with that I am going to turn it over to Marsha. Welcome.\":(\" Great thank you. Okay, let me share my screen. Okay um so um today I want to define just a few things about what maybe makes my coaching a little bit different and what to listen for. So I do come from uh and I C. F. Perspective uh and to me that means that I really focus on coaching the person in front of me, I'm coaching this person who has an issue and what is stopping this creative, resourceful and whole person from being able to solve this on their own. I really want to um dispel some of the stereotypes around um I cf coaching that there is a specific way and yes, you know there's there's training on skills and competencies in order to get your a C. C. Or PCC certification and we embed those. Um but to me the coaching is around around being really present and it's not that it's a very strict way. So you're gonna hear me doing things if you're an I. C. F. Coach you might go, oh wow, look at her. She uses a lot of closed questions. I do. And and it's because to me really nailing what it is drilling into, what is it this person really wants requires some clarification. And sometimes asking, is it this or is it this or you know, it sounds like that's most important to you. Um That may be the things that I use. So the I. C. F. Coaching model is really based on a process called reflective inquiry. And I say reflective because it's not just asking questions. The reflective part is really critical that we're holding up the mirror for the person to really listen to themselves and hear themselves. Because within that process they start to see, oh wow, Huh. Did I say that? Is that what I'm doing? And they start thinking for themselves in a way that they couldn't do on their own and to be able to do this, we have to create a very safe space. So uh in I. C. F. There's a lot around creating trust and intimacy. Um making sure that the person feels very comfortable because you may be touching on some things that create some vulnerability. So when we look at, when I'm talking about that. There are times when you're coaching that you don't even go through all the steps, sometimes the person just needs a sounding board. Um I had a client that she paid me a lot of money to come in and just listen and ask a few questions and and maybe um make a few reflections and she'd always have this incredible awareness. Um and oftentimes, one of the reasons I've chosen not to coach coaches is oftentimes coaches will coach themselves in the process, uh or they want to help the coach and and I want to make sure that that that doesn't happen. Um it doesn't always happen, but I just thought it was really important. So when I put out, I said, I really am looking for someone who's a non coach and we'll see how that goes. Um the most important thing is that when you have a client who really is circling, resisting jumping down side roads, and I'm sure most of you have had that situation, then I really believe that this process of of really getting them to look at what they're saying, who they are in this moment, what's really triggering them um is really critical and of course, you need an end destination. We have to know where we're going in order to keep things on track. But in those moments, then I really believe that what we're looking at is what's truly blocking this person um from knowing what to do, seeing what to do next, understanding the situation, uh in a way that if that we can create together again? That's very difficult and I can, in previous w back sessions, I talked about why we don't do self reflection well, and so you're you're doing them a great service by helping them think by being there thinking partner. So in this process, the reflective inquiry process when I talk about direct communication and that's my favorite competency is being just giving back to the person I received and I give back and direct communication is not challenging them, critiquing advising. And and and I say this because I teach um I'm in china twice a year, I've talked extensively around Asia and I always get that we're not direct, Our culture is not direct and I'm not talking about again being in someone's face, I'm talking about just being very clear and concise and sharing what I see what I hear um what I'm sensing, so reflecting is um what am I noticing? You're gonna hear me summarize a lot. So you're telling me this or I can tell that this is the thing that's really bothering you, is that true? So, seeing, hearing noticing? And and I also, in previous sessions, many of you, if you know me have heard me talk about using your entire nervous system. So opening not just your your mind with curiosity, but opening your heart and your gut. Um uh So you can really pull in from all your major processing centers, what is it the person is giving you and be able to reflect that back to them. So you, so what I'd like you to listen for is those times when I say, when I summarize, when I say, I notice this or I heard you say, you know, I'm sensing this is what's going on. And I know that when you say, you know, I'm sensing this is this true, that it's sometimes difficult to not interpret that you put your own opinion and you interpret what they're saying and that's not to say that I don't make that mistake as well. Um, but I'm truly trying to, you know, sometimes I'll choose a different word than the person says just to summarize it concisely. Um, but usually I use the words that they give me, um, and try not to add anything into it. And the more I can stay out of my head, the better I am at that I always say that thinking is the enemy of the coach. And so presence to me is really the key. So, um, what, what I'd like you to listen for is how you hear me reflecting what I see in here. I'm also gonna be looking for any patterns, um, any uh emotionally charged statements and, and the key I often find in coaching is the shift in emotion that I'll \n",
        "                                            be coaching someone and it's like, you know, just going along the way and all of a sudden there'll be a shift, they'll go from excited to quiet um or they'll be talking about something and they get really passionate about something and I'm going to reflect back that shift because something triggered that shift and that's usually the key um to to what it is we're looking at. So I really listen for that. Um again, I try to use their words as much as possible, so I'd like you to listen for that and and and again, please understand that you may hear something else and you may go a different way and and that's what's so beautiful about coaching is that there's many paths to take. So Christine has been coached by a couple of coaches and I'm sure she's gonna find, I'm entirely different, you know? So there's not one right way to coaching and that's also what's wonderful is that, you know, you might have a coach for a while and then decide you want someone new because they come at it a different way. So that's what we're going to look at today, so we'll just get to it. So let me stop my share. I'm gonna move it to there. Okay, and I'm gonna go to a full screen. Yes, I can see you, so Christine, thank you and it's again, for the audience um Christine was kind of like the sub and then everybody else backed out and so she just knew a couple of days ago I said you're up, so thank you so much for being available. Yeah, yeah, so um and and again, full disclosure. So we briefly talked and the reason why is because I've not coached her, I just want to make sure that whatever she had was a coaching topic and not looking for advice or mentoring and she did and that's about all that we got into. So I'm somewhat familiar with what she's going to bring, but Christine what I'd like you to do is just um you know, tell me a little bit about, you know, this this thing that you're you're you're dealing with that you want to talk about today. Yeah, thank you. Um So I am off work at the moment. I've just started being a student, but part of the trigger behind where I came to being a student was I had a actually it was a year long headache that was diagnosed as a neck injury. And so I've been getting physio on my neck for the last four months. Um and so I'm about to sort of, you know, go back into wanting to look for work. Um And one thing that is on my mind is my self care because I do have habits of um having a self care plan and it all goes um it's all looking really good and then things happen and things go wayward and then all of a sudden I crash um and I've also got a history of a chronic illness in my early thirties. So for me, self care plan is quite important because I have had a few periods in my life where illness or injuries have sort of come about. So yeah, so that's something that I know I need in my in my life, okay, And but it sounds like it's something that you've been dealing with for a very long time trying to get on this regime of self care. Is that true? It is, I mean it's, I mean it's a continual thing, so I'm always sort of looking at new ways to sort of monitor and and so forth. But like one thing for me is, I know like I just did this last week, I and my partner goes nuts at me because he goes, you just do change too fast, you know, here I am rehabbing myself and I go to the gym and I and increase my weight last week and you know, feeling really was feeling really good, just mess things up and so I kind of do this, introduce things a little bit too fast and these repercussions and I do know that when you do like returning to work or so forth, you don't need to sort of introducing things, but I get a little bit kind of frustrated with the down that comes after it, I guess, so I do these things and then can I kick myself and go, why did I do that? And I did it again and then my partner's guy, you did it again chris so okay, so you have a sense of what gets in your way. So um, if if you were then to have a situation where you felt you were consistent with your self care, what would that look like? Okay, it would be that the up and downs wouldn't be so dramatic. So I like kind of like, and I think that I think the fear is of going back to work is is that I'm introducing a whole new element and a whole new, you know, at the moment I'm kind of excluded from people unless I bring them in, but for me going back into the work environment particularly, I've just sit in good posture and so some of my fears there is I lose my posture, which I did last week as well from studying and just things like I got caught up in my study and was tilting my head and so forth and then all of a sudden bang and so it's those sort of behaviors that I kind of can't see the triggers coming and then all of a sudden it's the snowballs. So, um, but that's an interesting thing. So you, you just mentioned about uh posture and, and that's really important to you because of your injury. So, um, is that the biggest thing that that goes, that you're afraid of as you go back to work? No, it's probably more the whole setting in terms of, you know, like being in the good posture, but also introducing um\",\"option\"),\n",
        "                                          \" um and the idea was we would love to see live coaching demonstrations, We want to see people actually do this so that we can be better and so we made it happen and you guys have loved them so much that we decided to bring them forward into the full summit so that they're available to our full summit pass holders and I do want to just quickly launch a poll for you, um you should see it on your screen now, if you could please just take a minute to fill it out, it's a super quick poll and I'm gonna leave it up for the duration of the session. In fact, I'll leave it up three minutes beyond the session so that everybody has the opportunity to share their feedback with us. Mhm And now I'm gonna go ahead and ask kristen if you can just pop the link again one more time into the chat box. So folks have it, if they haven't opened the chat box yet for the passes as well as the facebook link, if they want to join the conversation and share their golden nugget from tonight's session. And so now I'm gonna go ahead and take some questions. So again we had lots and lots of of expressions of thanks to both you Marsha and to you Christine for allowing us to be flies on the wall and and listen to this amazing session. So let's see. We had a couple of themes so I'll touch on the themes. Um A couple of folks were saying are wanting to kind of clarify difference between coaching and asking for advice, coaching and advising coaching and mentoring, coaching and therapy. Can you just kind of touch on that Marcia?\":(\" Yeah, I do want to say one of the things because I know I said it this morning and didn't today that there is a difference between giving information and giving advice. So a couple of times to Christine, I did share uh just briefly um some information and and that's okay, that's not telling her what to do with it. Um But you know, mentoring is when I'm sharing with you my ideas, my giving advice, telling you what to do. I didn't tell her what to do with her worry. I could have but she had this, you know, again I want to come back to the I. C. F. Definition of coaching is that you are a partner. I'm her partner not not her advice giver or her therapist, I'm partnering with her and she's a creative, resourceful and whole person, she's not broken, she's not broken, I don't need to fix her, even when she got emotional, I do not need to fix her. You know, I'm often, um I see that so often with coaches and so they want to jump in and go, don't feel that way. I don't need to take care of her. She's fully capable. She's a smart, creative, confident, um resourceful, whole person and I know that she's going to bring this forth on her own. Um, and so that's the difference. Um, and and therapy, you know, I I did ask how long this has been going on, but you noticed I didn't go into, I never even asked her what, you know what it was, her illness and how that impacted her. I I don't really need to go too much into her history. Um If I felt that her level of fear or worry was um debilitating that, that she could not get over it. Um then I would suggest talking to a therapist or a counselor that would not be a coaching issue, but but it wasn't because she said she has ways and I asked her, I said, is there things in the past that you've done and she said yes, and and and that's what led me to even like, okay, so is this, you know, and fears tends to be based in Reality-other worried is not. So when I said, is this fear of worry, whether she knew that she knew right away, if you notice she said, oh no, it's a worry. So it's something in her new that distinction. So, um although fear can be made up as well, so uh I never felt the need to to shift into any kind of what would be therapeutic therapy. I mean, there's many therapies that are similar to coaching, like cognitive behavioral therapy looks at limiting beliefs and things like that. So, so you could say, wow, you were doing some of that. Well, reflective inquiry is very similar to some modes of therapy, but again, I did not go back into her past patterns, or when did she actually start questioning her abilities in her life? I never asked her that question. So that would be the the line and honestly, those of you, I don't know if it's just available to members or not, but if you're nicely f member, they just came out with a wonderful piece on the distinction between therapy and coaching and I believe it's in the ethics portion on the website. Um So, you know, I would look for that because I know that they sent it out to all the members. So it was a really well done peace. So I hope that answers it. Mhm.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" Thank you for that. And so Sharon has a question for Christine, she's saying what was the turning point in the session for you and you know, what was the most powerful moment?\":(\" I think it was probably when I started tearing up because that's probably when it really become real like, oh this is really meaning something. It was I think probably going back to that worry and I didn't think this was about worrying when I started, I didn't think I'd have a few tears, but I know I said to the person, so probably wasn't surprised, you know, I just want to say that also. Um often in the reflective process when people really then all of a sudden see themselves in a way they've not been looking at themselves before they will have an emotional reaction. So whether you you're a sensitive person or not, you know, I talked about that, you know, in the research I did for the discomforts on my book that that realization will trigger an emotional response. And it could be anything from tears to anger. I've had clients hang up on me scream at me and hang up on me. You know, unfortunately they call me back two. But part of coaching then is to be able to just hold the space, you know, for whatever reaction they have emotions are just energy moving through the body and it's not bad. It's it's you judge yourself for your not bad. They're not bad and they're just a thing that we as human beings experience. You know, we always want our robots to be yeah, more human with emotions, but we want our the robots, you know, so it's it's a part of living. Um so I'm just sharing this with the coaches. Is that that's okay if there's a reaction that means there was an awareness and there's growth. Um so I always say, you know the coaches it's okay if you make your client uncomfortable because that's the process of of of of awareness and growing um that that will help them to move forward with whatever it is they're facing. So yeah, thank\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          \" Let's see. So we're getting a lot again, lots of thank you's and um, let's see. Someone asked earlier about the homework. I know you talked briefly about homework for Christine. Um, I think it was Janet that was asking that question, what was the homework that you were telling? Christine to do?\":(\" You know? She just said, um, when I asked her what were some other things that would around that would help her to recall her her strength, right Christine. It was to be able to recall her strength. And she, she says, I don't know. I have to think about it. And so I just want to make sure that she's going to go think about it. So that's why I said, wow, it sounds like that's some homework or some, you know, something you need to do. It's not like I want you to turn it into me by 2:00 tomorrow I guess I guess because I've been coached before, I kind of knew that you kind of have some action steps at the end. So the use of the word homework wasn't endorsing to me. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. And I actually like homework personally give me some action. You giving women the precocious woman, you\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                                          ' got the right shirt on. Okay, So guy is asking um when a client is determined for you to provide them with ideas or give advice, how do you handle that? How do you how do you back out of that?':(\" You know, it's an interesting thing. Again, I I I often say, you know, I really believe in you and I think you do have some ideas and I'd like to hear yours first. Um you know, and it is interesting because oftentimes I have coach like brand new managers and there are sometimes where I realize that this isn't about coaching, this is about mentoring. This person has no idea, has no experience and has no idea and you can't coach to nothing, you know? But but I I let the person know, it's like, okay, it sounds like it's not about coaching you in this moment that that there's, you know, that you would like some ideas to choose from. I rarely um do that, but sometimes, like I said sometimes if they have nothing to drawn then then it's crazy uh to keep coaching. So, you know, the thing is is it a knowledge, um um or skills lack, then it's not coaching if it's a motivation or confidence, then it's coaching, Like one of the women that actually volunteered for this um and I said, so what would you like coaching on? And she said I really want to know how to take my book and find a publisher and how to create more visibility, that's not a coaching topic, and I said, you know what, I'd love to help you, but it sounds like you want the benefit of my experience. Um And so I actually gave her a half hour since she raised her hand and I said I'll give you a half hour of mentor, you know, advice giving, but but that's not, you know, I'm not gonna coach you on that, so that will come up, I mean she had no idea what to do and so that that's a whole different thing, but I hesitate when people say, oh I don't know what to do, I really ask, is that they don't know where they're afraid of admitting what to do, you know, where it's like, oh I can't make a decision, I need you to help me. Well frankly, most people have already made the decision, they're just afraid to accept the decision that they've made. Um you know, and so it's like I'm looking for, which is the one they have more energy, what's the decision they have more energy around, so don't get sucked into that, I don't know what to do, Help me, Their creative, resourceful and whole\",\"goal\"),\n",
        "                                          \" wonderful. Um So mary's asking I'm wondering how, you know when to acknowledge a client's emotions and when to let them pass because I know we saw that Christine got emotional earlier and you you mentioned it was not my job to make that right?\":(\" And it's okay\",\"option\"),\n",
        "                                          ' for people to be uncomfortable. So where do you go with that? And when do you acknowledge? And when do you let it go okay':(\" with crying? I usually give them some space, okay. And I won't I never say, oh do you need some time and you know, all that, I just, you know, give them just a little bit of space or like I just I let her breathe a little bit and said, so tell me what's going on. Um So I don't want to delve into it, I don't want to make this a weakness or make her feel bad that she's crying. Um You know, so it's just again, I just kind of allow all criers come out of it if you allow them okay and they always tell you okay, I'm fine or something, so and I'm a crier too, so you know, you give them a little space, they'll come out of it and it'll be fine. Um the discomfort with, you know, I'm drilling down into something here. Um and I'm gonna take you with me and it's not gonna feel so good. Well okay that's fine. I can tell again, because I'm present. If this is like not a place they want to go, then I'll then I'll stop say, okay, I get that, this isn't you don't want to go there, so let's go back to this. And that's why you must be present, you must be present with your client to know where they are. And are they really willing um to go there with you, Is it okay? Even if it's uncomfortable, so stay present and sense where they're at, They're giving you signals and you just need to pick it up and give it back. Don't be afraid of emotions and I'm sharing this because that's a big part of the work. So, I mean, you can find a lot of this just in my blog, you don't have to get the book, but you know, you can find a lot of stuff about how to deal with your own emotions and other people's emotions and I have shared a lot and come to my full summit, I'm going to do another demo and talk about this more deeply thank\",\"goal\"),\n",
        "                                          \" okay. Um and this is a question coincidentally came up from someone else. So julie is saying, I am an internal coach and I'm being asked to coach someone that's in performance management, told this person that it doesn't, coaching doesn't work if you're not open to it, but they're going to meet with them. But she's saying her question is, how do you respectfully end a coaching engagement? What do you do when it's not working?\":(\" Well, there's two things here, like, in the moment, you know, if if the coach, the client is resistant and doesn't really want this, then I would call it right there and say, okay, it clearly that you've been told you need to be coached and this isn't something you really want to do. Is that true? Um, I would call it, and and then, you know, I have had earlier in my career, especially, you know, more remedial type of coaching with people who needed coaching and, you know, and I would say, okay, I know what they want, but we have this time together, I said, you know, it's like, what would be most useful for you to work through that I can help you with since we have this time together.

So, so I see if we can't get to something, but I did have a guy that I kept saying, you know, it's like we come to this and you tell me all the good things you do and all the bad things your boss do and that you're not giving me anything that to work with you um to get better on and and so I don't know where we're going with the coaching um and you know, and and we actually ended that, so there's that if the client isn't showing up to sessions, um if this is a repetitive action, then, you know, I will call them out on that as well and say, so it doesn't seem that the coaching is all that important to you because sometimes, you know, when they're not paying for it themselves, you know, the company is paying for whatever, They don't value it as much and and uh yeah, I understand, I reschedule at times and I know people have meetings but they have to make it important and they have to show a pattern of making it important. Um so we'll end it there, but oftentimes will just disappear. That's the end of that and I'll need to let them to HR no or whatever, it's like, well they haven't come to three sessions were done.

Um, there's always a slight shift um, with the keyword and the keyword is usually an adjective, a descriptive word. Um or it's a picture like roller coaster, okay, which was his metaphor. So it's a descriptive word or a metaphor that they use. That that seemed to be really and a big part of their thinking. Um, and so this is why presence is so critical because if you're thinking about what question I should ask you will miss it. And I see coaches do this all the time. You know, the client will give it to them. They'll have the the shift and the word but the coaches stuck in what questions should I ask and they miss it. I'm like you missed it, you missed the key word. So you've got to trust that however able you are to coach right now is good enough. And and questions should never come from your memory. Questions should always come from your curiosity in the moment. Okay. I don't think about questions at the beginning. Maybe like you know what's on your mind and at the end, you know, when are you gonna do this? What resources do you need? That's the book ends, the book ends are standard. But during the coaching, I never um recall a question that I saw on a list or a coach told me, it always comes from the conversation and usually following a reflection and that's why it's reflective\":(' inquiry',\"Reality-other\"),\n",

I need to hear what is it you want instead. So I reflected, I hear it. So their self esteem, I hear you're getting rejected. I hear that um what is it that you need? What is it you want instead I need that the outcome, the outcome is not a problem. The outcome is a desired state. Okay then I can go back to um uh rejection self esteem, whatever I can go back to that, but I'm not asking what problem he wants to work on. I'm asking what outcome he wants to create. This is a huge distinction that coaches need to be, remember, otherwise you're going to chase them with all the problems they present instead of getting very clear on where are we going with this, what is it you want instead? And what he wanted was kind of dual, you know, the sense of uh and the energy to keep the energy up. Um but it was, the key word to me was consistency because I'm like what keeps your energy up? So that wasn't even the outcome. When he said when I'm consistent with this, I was like, oh there it is, there's what I really, really want is somehow to maintain consistency because then those dips won't be so low, my self esteem won't be so so damaged. Okay, so I had to drill down to what it is he really wanted, okay, in order to know where are we going with this and then how do those problems play into that? That outcome is critical and not.

I also started to involved the rest of my management team and then later on the rest of the team were 50 50 people in Belgium into coaching because I thought that we could do a lot better uh, on communication and I thought it had an immediate effect, certainly on the management management team where they spoke to each other in a different way than they were used to. It was a very siloed organization before and that is something from a management style. I hate, I like them to talk to each other and not always to me and then I need to pass on the message. So we were coached on that and there was an evolution and at a certain time I thought, well, you know, this is going well, I can let go a little bit more of the Belgian team, they need less of my attention and that backfired immediately, as soon as I felt that I let go, they were falling back into old habits today we are again two years further down the line and again, I have that same feeling I can let go more because by now they should know how to communicate to each other, which they do, but it's still not entirely where I wanted to be, but at the same time I have my own ambition which I feel is becoming more and more international and european level again. So I am struggling today with when is it okay for me to let go the Belgian team who's asking still asking for that attention?

Okay, let's think together for a moment before we wrap up of how we might proceed to try to give you some help with this.

You know, what's the chances of someone slamming into you or what's the chances of you being stranded out there on the highway. And even if you were stranded, is there a way you could cope without her manager actually can get back home? So these are some things that we could begin to do. So I'm gonna mark here, we could work on these thoughts and then by working on the thoughts, we might be able to help you reduce the emotions.

That sounds like whenever you get into one of your anxiety attacks, you get into a pattern of breathing that I suspect maybe it makes things harder for you. And you told me about that one time when you actually had a fainting spell whenever you started breathing real fast. So it'll be okay to try to see if we could learn some things that would help you manage your breathing whenever you're going to one of these panic attacks. Actually, there's been a fair amount of research done now that shows that if people can learn how to breathe in a certain way that calms them and settles them down, that actually that technique alone can be one of the very top things that you can do to get control of our anxiety. Right? So let's just spend a little time talking about breathing. Now. Do you have a sense of uh you know how often people breathe when they're, how many, how many breasts people take a minute whenever they're calm and resting and not particularly nervous? I\":(\" guess if I'm not nervous, I don't think about my breathing. So we'll just,\",\"Reality-self\"),\n",
        "                              \" Minute, 30. Some people say 50, 60, 70 I've heard as high as that, that sounds fast. Does it actually the correct number is about 15 or 16 rest a minute. Okay, so if you had a watch and you were timing these things would be maybe about one every four seconds. That's both in and out. And when people get into an anxiety attack, how how fast do you think they breathe typically? Pretty quick? Pretty quick?\":(' Like a dog',\"option\"),\n",
        "                              \" panting? Really? Is that the way you do it? Okay? So whenever you're going to a panic attack, you're breathing faster? And what else do you think changes when you're, when you're in a panic\":(\" attack? Well I've noticed I start out kind of shallow and then I feel like I don't get enough air and so then it gets deeper and deeper and doesn't help though. I just feel like I can't get enough air any\",\"Reality-self\"),\n",
        "                              \" And how fast do you think I'm breathing?\":(' I guess if I counted it maybe 12 or 15 times a minute every few seconds',\"Reality-self\"),\n",
        "                              \" And how about my mouth gasping for air, breathing faster, making a lot of noise when I breathe? Alright, so this is the way people breathe when they're feeling calm and I suspect it's how you breathe when you're feeling. In fact, I've seen you and that's pretty much how you breathe. So really the trick here is simply figuring out a way to change your breathing pattern from what you were showing me when you were into your panic attack and what it's like when you're breathing normally. Now, I've often had people coming to me that have been in therapy and have had instructions so forth. And I asked them about breathing training, They say, oh yeah, I've had breathing training, another therapist taught me what to do and I said, well what are you supposed to do? And they say, well you just take a lot of deep breaths and maybe that's okay in the beginning of trying to get handover panic attack, but if you keep doing that you're gonna end up maybe even breathing just like you were breathing. So I'll show you what I think a panic attack looks like and see if you think it makes sense of the way you see it. So somebody's feeling pretty common and all of a sudden panic attack comes over. So here's what they look like. Is that sort of likely what you interesting whenever I do that, I sort of get dizzy in my head and I feel like my vision changes and I feel like I get tingly because what's happening to your physiology that's in your body is that you are actually blowing off too much carbon dioxide. You're breathing so fast that, you know when we breathe in, we're getting in oxygen, we breath that we're breathing out carbon dioxide, you're breathing out too much carbon dioxide and you feel like you're trying to get your breath. But actually what you're doing is you're making things worse. So what we need to do is to figure out a way to stop that. And one of the favorite things that I've found that helped a lot of people is simply to recognize when you're into one of those breathing patterns, when you feel in a panic attack to spot it, that you're breathing faster and more deeply than normal. And then if you have a watch with a second hand one of those, okay, you can just take a look at your watch And then try to slow your breathing down to this one, cycle in and out in four seconds and it might take you a little while to do that at the beginning. You need to take just a nice calm deep breath or two to kick it in. You can do that. So I'm gonna now simulate it again. I'll show you going into a panic attack and I'm gonna show you how I would try to break the panic attack by looking at my watch and then slowing my breathing. And then the last thing I suggest doing is trying to bring into your mind a very calming image. Try to take yourself to a place when you're free of anxiety, someplace that's really soothing and comforting and we don't have a worry in the world. Do you have any place like that? You can take yourself in your mind, what would that\":(\" be to the park and feeding the ducks and that's kind of nice time.\",\"Reality-self\"),\n",

Some people have tons of negative and not much positive. Some people, tons of positive, not much negative depending on what their parents are like, but everybody has a bit of both. So you seem to have all of your positive feelings on your birth mom and pretty much all of your negative feelings on your adopted mom. So I'm wondering whether there's actually a little bit of the opposite there. I'm wondering if maybe you at least a little bit love your adoptive mom and a little bit you're angry and resentful at your biological mom. Like anywhere underneath. Do you ever feel any hint of anything like that?\":(\" I mean, I don't, I don't hate my adopted mom. I don't hate her and I hate, I don't like my adopted mom. She's just, she's been my mom. I don't hate her sometimes she's okay, but it's just lately she's gotten a lot worse. I think. I think she's having a harder time with me being a young woman,\",\"Reality-self\"),\n",
        "                         \" So when you're asking yourself that question, why hasn't your birth mom tried harder? You just make the block by your adopted mom be bigger and bigger and bigger.

        "                         \"Well, maybe the answer doesn't have to do with your adoptive mom at all. Maybe your biological mom just hasn't tried to find you?\":(\"Oh, I don't think that's right.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
        "                         ' If you even consider that, How does that feel?':(\" I don't want to think about that, why would she not want to find me? I mean, I'm a great kid.\",\"Reality-self\"),\n",

There wouldn't be so much conflict with her in the present. Also, sometimes she may be over strict and we can meet with her and talk to her about that\":(\" would you please?

And I think that those will help ease the situation and help both of you communicate a lot better and get the point across that you wanted to get across. Lastly, when you kind of finish hearing and understanding each other, just talk about i statements when, when you're working on mirroring and expressing your opinions and so say don't say you made me feel this way like you did this. Just say, I feel hurt because I think that you don't trust me or whatever it is that you're feeling. So try to practice those. Um, and just in the middle of the argument, see if that helps to calm things down and just settle the situation rather than feeling that you need that distance instead. But it's okay if you need to leave the room too. So yeah, we'll go ahead and try that and we can set up another session in a couple of weeks.

I think this this feeling that it was all out in the open and I didn't need to hide anything anymore was was again quite powerful and and I did actually find that actually going out and meeting people even informally and getting out of the house actually really did a lot for me, and I think going public about it actually enabled me to do that,\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",

And I think in terms of my religion and spirituality, I think there was initially quite a sense of guilt about it, this shouldn't have happened, but also, I think it, I think it did actually change my, my spiritual attitude as well, because as christians, you know, believe you believe that jesus became human was one of us and I started reading some of the bible stories and thinking, well, if this has happened to me, these are the kinds of challenges that would have happened to jesus, and what did he make of it? And I think as I read through the Gospel stories, I could see that well, maybe he was depressed as well, you know, maybe he felt abandoned by people, you know, maybe maybe he was challenged by personal relationships and I think that gave me a sort of a different interpretation of what I was reading and so rather than the feeling that he was against me, wagging your finger at me, I actually got the feeling that, Well, yes, actually he's gone through these things too, and I think that was really was quite a changing point, although it was gradual over a period of time, but I think reading different things into the stories I think was quite important.

So I think that that break from ministry I think was important because the difficulty of ministry is that you're in it all the time, you know, you wear a dog collar and everybody knows who you are kind of stuff. And I think actually going into some doing something different like being a teacher, which is obviously, it's hard work, but nevertheless, at the end of the day, you know, you cast that role off and you're you're yourself again in a funny kind of way.

And I think in in my ministry now, I've tried to encourage people with mental health difficulties, you know, not to stay behind closed doors, but to get out into the community and, you know, offer my support to enable them to do that. So, I think looking back on myself, you know, just get out even, it's just walking the dog, but just get outside and being outside actually does more good than just sitting at home.

I may have to write a book one day. Um Well I come from a family background of where I was only child, but I do have a half brother and a relationship with him\", \"Reality-self\"),\n",
        "                         \" So you mentioned, you mentioned your the fact that you're an only child, your half brother, the fact that your parents were divorced, your mom, you seem to be having some issues around her. So there seems to be quite a few components to like in everybody's life that sort of mix up, you know how you function and exist in this life and what where your pleasures are and where you're facing your your difficulties. So I take it that all the things you mentioned, your brother, your mother, the divorce, your dad, your current relationship, there seems to be a lot going on. So I don't want to just assume that to just jump into one of those which do you feel at this point in time you would like to talk about maybe that's impacted me the most that we can maybe try and look into it, you know, in a bit more detail and then obviously moving forward, we would need to discuss what are our goals gonna be for the sessions when we need um what you hope to get out of the sessions and where it's going to go and how we're going to work towards a place where you can have fulfillment and peace of mind and function. Like you already mentioned, you you derive strength. I'd like to know more where you get that strength from what creates it and see where we can sort of bring some more balance into the other areas of your life. So if you have to, because obviously in all our sessions will go through all of that. But if you have to choose one that you feel is the most pertinent for you to discuss today, where would you start? And then I'd also like to hear more about your strength because I think that's important to recognize what's good in your life. But let's talk about one issue today that you feel you'd like to focus on.\":(\" I think it would actually be my mom because if I put her, so if I'm in a mind map and I look at my mom, my mom is sort of connected to every other block that I put in that mind. So it's Sasha and its mom and then it's everybody else. So the relationship that I have, my mom obviously has a change reaction with the relationship that I have with my brother as well as the relationship that I have\",\"Reality-self\"),\n",
        "                         \" child. That's interesting because one of the questions I wanted to ask you is us separated from them for seven years during a critical developmental phase of your life um and and something came to mind that it seems now in your relationship with your mom that you do a lot for her now, it's quite interesting because do you feel like possibly there's a sense of responsibility on you to be doing those things?\":(\" I do, I'll give you an example um when my, we had a break in this year and I almost felt so responsible for that breaking because there was an altercation that occurred between my mom myself and my brother in november last year and he moved in, so I had no choice but to move out because it's very uncomfortable to live with him and I had the option of moving out. Um and so I did, and then in february when that break in happened, I felt like if I was there, then it may have been different, then it may have been that the people who broke in wouldn't have seen that somebody was in the room and using that room and they wouldn't have targeted the house and then I, so firstly I blame myself for that, I held myself responsible for that and I shouldn't have, but I did and and then my mom went into a frantic uh sort of, she was in a bad place at the time of that breaking and she could not think she could not move, she could only cry. And I had to be the parent again. I had to make sure that I drove her to the police station to get a statement from her. I had to take her to trauma counseling. I had to call the insurance company to make sure that they came through. I had to get 80 to come through and upgrade the security system in the house. I had to make sure that the insurance company sent somebody to cut off the tree because that's how the burglars entered. And it's like everything that I had to do. And I had to also make sure that the dog was fine because they poisoned him and I had to drive the dog to the vet and make sure that they gave him the medication and make sure that he was taking his medication every day for a week and she was off work. So it became like I was the parent and I felt responsible for my mother. It is, and it becomes, it almost becomes too much.\",\"Reality-self\"),\n",
        "                         \" succession. What's interesting is you use the word emotional blackmail so you can see it happening. So it's not that you can't see it, it's not like I'm sitting here and I can see that this is emotional blackmail and such as not seeing it. You can see it for what it is. So what is it about that if you can see this clearly that this is emotional blackmail and she's using all these instances of having taken you out of an environment with your dad that was unhealthy and feeling like you owe her your life? Do you feel that way? I mean, you can see it's emotional blackmail, but how do you feel? Do you feel like you're over\":(\" your life? No, I don't. Um I feel like as a daughter, I have responsibility towards my mom and don't get me wrong, I love it to bits and and the love is there love will always be there. Um it's just that I think that the way we started off our relationship was as friends and I'm guessing that that's where the problem started because my mom would rely on me for emotional support and mental support, not really physical. And and I and I have been there and she's never really and and she's she's my best friend and I'm her best friend. But at the end of the day we are mother and daughter,\",\"Reality-self\"),\n",
        "                         \" which is quite an interesting concept this, this mixing friends with a parenting role because with, it's almost like with a friend, there's still boundaries in place and there should be boundaries in place to a certain extent between parents and Children. And it seems like that boundary has been blurred a bit. So you want a mom, mom, but at the same time you've got a best friend and it seems like those roles have been a bit, the boundaries have been blurred. Um so I think what I would like to do with you over the next couple of sessions because it seems that there's a lot we can talk about, okay, is I would like to look more into discussing with you thinking and how the nature they're thinking creates your feelings and create your behavior and the reason why I would like to discuss that with you is because everything we experience through life is through our thinking. So the way you're going to think about your mom, the way you're going to think about the relationship, how it should be, how it shouldn't be, what's right, what's wrong is going to impact that relationship is going to impact your relationship with your your boyfriend. I'd also like to go more into that because I think if you understand maybe the way your mom thinks, you don't need to be feeding into everything she says or taking everything she says personally or seriously you can be able to decide for yourself, Okay what sort of thinking is she and what is that creating for her? Do I need to take it seriously? Do I need to feed into it or can I just let her go and decide what is going to impact what isn't? Because if you think of the state of our minds and how busy they are all the time. If you're thinking about your mom and worrying about her, your brother, your father, your boyfriend and trying to integrate all of this. You can be incredibly busy thinking thinking thinking all the time, which is going to lead to certain feeling certain behaviors. So I think when we try and get an understanding of, first of all your years apart from her then when you came back together with her how that relationship was rebuilt what implications it had. And I think also we can discuss about how to set boundaries between your relationship with her and your relationship with your boyfriend and how not to to almost separate them. That one doesn't impact the other because it's challenge. A relationship with a parent should be a relationship with a parent is very different to a relationship with a boyfriend. And what I'm hearing is that there's almost jealousy from her. Yeah. So if you were to feed into that, it could create a lot of distress for you and you would be trying to make her feel better when sometimes it's not really necessary. So, so I think maybe what we should do is we'll discuss a bit further today, we'll go into more detail, We can look at that relationship, what you're years were apart from her, like and that reintegration of this relationship and then moving forward, we can um set some goals go through. You know, the various relationships you have with the key people in their life and I think we can work through it, but it's gonna take properly quite a few sessions and are you okay\":(' with that as long as I can get the help I need',\"Reality-self\"),\n",

Yeah. So I guess I'm somebody who kind of really likes homework if you will. I feel like it's helpful for me to have resources to look at. I I would like to know a little bit more scientifically about depression and whatnot and I just don't really know, you know, I've done a google search, I don't really know what is a reliable source. So that would be really helpful. It is a bewildering morass out there, isn't it? Yes. So some specific and scientifically based self help resources for depression then. Yes. Yeah. That would be really affirming for me. Yeah. Alright. And you said you disliked frequent sessions so you're looking then for what every two weeks? Yeah maybe we can try to and then if if I need less, that would be good. I just felt that I've done it before where I have to do it weekly and and it just feels that almost makes me anxious. Like it it feels like a task um that is just like added into my my schedule. Like I'm really busy with work and I'm raising my kid by myself and it's just like I don't know, I don't feel like I have time to integrate what we talk about into my daily life. So it would be nice if we could start with two and then if I need maybe even every three weeks um if that's possible to change it later on. Well thank you for voicing those preferences. We'll certainly try to honor those. So let's begin every two weeks assess progress and we'll see how it goes from there. How does that sound? Yeah, that sounds really good. Thank you. All right. And this is the way we hope to work in therapy together to calibrate or individualize therapy to you. Yeah. No, that's nice. Thank you. Before we got online today I was doing some reflection like you asked me to and um I'm feeling a lot better actually when I sat down to think about it, like I don't feel as depressed, which is really nice. I'm sleeping a lot better, which again, I hadn't really noticed until I reflected on it. Um And my appetites returned so I don't feel I don't find myself really skipping lunch like I used to and during a busy day like I'm actually hungry so I think that's all really promising. Yeah. Yeah. And I think part of that is the the new mood workbook that you suggested has been really nice for me because it lets me do something when I have downtime and the activities like we talked about a few weeks ago really helped me integrate what we talked about in our sessions into my light. Um Rather than just having so many sessions and then when I'm not talking to you I would normally feel like you know just back to where I started. So the workbook is helpful for keeping the work going well. I'm delighted to learn that it's working for you and I'll also add you were the one who suggested you wanted those online self help resources. So congrats to you for knowing what works specifically for you. Yeah thanks. That's yeah that's good to hear. And you know we also talked about calibrating or pacing the frequency of our sessions, How does that help work for you? Yeah. Yeah so like I was kind of saying before that it is helpful, I know that we started with two weeks and then we kind of pushed it to three weeks which has been really nice um especially with with the workbook because again I get to I get to learn to do these kind of coping mechanisms on my own rather than just always waiting until the next therapy session or being you know scared that like oh I didn't do that, the kind of homework that you wanted me to do because I didn't have time. So the pace has been a lot better, oh that's lovely and this is seamlessly integrating. Then our sessions with all the hard work you're doing at home. So again congrats to you um you've been able to personalize your therapy, you know, combining our sessions and the self help material at a pace. That's ideal Tanya,\":(\" it's great to see you for our session and to see again. Um you know, normally we start the sessions by you talking about what's going on for you and how things are, but I just wanted to check and see how things are going in terms of kind of what you wanted from the therapy you said at the beginning when we first met that you really wanted space to talk and get things out there and you know, I just wondered how that's been going and whether you have a sense of whether that's still what you want or whether there's something different you'd want at this point. Yeah, I was wanting to speak to you about that and I really appreciate you asking me um yeah, things are going okay, you know, everything's going at the pace, it should be going out and I'm thanking you for that, I don't feel pushed to anything. Um I think that\",\"Reality-self\"),\n",

Can I offer you a bottle of water today? No, thank you. I'm fine. Okay, so as I mentioned before, my name is Alyssa harms. I'm a social worker here at Oceanside counseling center. I specialize in family counseling, substance abuse as well as child welfare. I see that you've had the opportunity to read through the contract, but I wanted to let you know again that everything we discussed within our meetings today and going forward. I will honor confidentiality unless of course you talk about harming yourself or others. How does that sound to you? That sounds fine. I'm just a little concerned about your age. You look really young. And can I ask how long you've been doing this or how old, you know, I, I don't mind at all. I'm actually glad that you brought that to my attention. I've been with this company now for two months. I have been fully trained to work through situations such as this. I am 100% confident in my ability to work with you and I would love the pleasure to do that with you if you give me that chance. Okay. Yeah, that sounds fair. Great. So I do recall that you were referred to us by your pastor robert White House and you've had some concerns about your alcohol intake as well as concerns within your family. So today's session is going to involve a lot of me asking questions to get a better understanding of where we are this way we could work together to develop a plan to help you overcome some of those struggles throughout the meeting. You will see me taking some notes about some of the stuff that we're talking about and so far, how does everything sound to you? It sounds good. Um Just the only thing is that, you know, as you know, I've been through treatment a couple of times before and um I've gone back to drinking each time, so I just don't know what's going to be different this time. Okay, so you're saying that you were in treatment in the past and sometime after your treatment, you reverted back to alcohol and that maybe you have some concerns and you're worried about how this time it will go for you. Yeah, I mean, you know, I want to control my drinking and I'm aware that it's been a problem. I just question myself sometimes. Okay, well, you know, I don't want you worrying so much about what happened in the past. We're gonna focus on what we're doing today and I do want to acknowledge that you are here today and you're taking that step forward to make some changes and that's a huge accomplishment. Something that you should be proud of for doing. So I didn't really think about that. Okay, so I do recall that you were in inpatient treatment in the past and you just mentioned again that you reverted back to alcohol. Let's go over some of the things that may be triggered that drinking, what happened during that time to make you go back to alcohol, I can't I don't know, I really can't think of any specific. I just um I lost control of my life. And when you say you lost control of your life, what are you referring to? What does, what does that mean to you? Well, shortly after my daughter Marie was born, my father passed away and that was very traumatic because I grew up with both of my parents, but my mom is an alcoholic. So I don't have much of a relationship with her and you know, I've always been daddy's little girl. So maybe that was part of, I can only imagine how tough it must have been for you to lose your father at that time in your life. It seems to me that maybe at that point you felt extremely depressed, which is understandable. So what happened was I ended up drinking with my youngest daughter Cynthia and unfortunately now she has fetal alcohol syndrome. So it's been really tough dealing with that. I'm sure that's been tough for you and your family. Our agency has some information regarding fetal alcohol syndrome at the ending of today's session. If you're into, I can give you that information and it goes over ways to get you connected with other parents who are also in a similar situation as your own. So, if that's something you're interested in, you can definitely provide you with that. I mean it sounds like a great idea, but I just don't know how I'm gonna find time. I'm so busy. Okay. But I do notice that you're extremely motivated. Um, let's talk about some of the support systems you have, who would you describe to be in your support circle? Um, well my pastor, we're talking about about him, he's very supportive and then my sister april, she's, she's been great. So she's probably like my biggest supporter besides pastor. That's great that you would say that your sister is a big support in your life at this moment. I am concerned that you didn't mention your husband. How is your relationship with your husband? How is he dealing with everything at this moment? Well, you know, I'm not sure sometimes. I feel like he's angry at me because of my drinking and I think he blames me for, you know, the situation with Cynthia. So, um it's not like it used to be with us. It's not like it used to be. Could you explain more about that? Well, I just feel like my husband blames me for Cynthia's fetal alcohol syndrome and you know, it's really putting a strain on our marriage, I just, I feel like I let him down. So you're saying to me if I'm understanding correctly that things haven't quite been the same since he was diagnosed and you feel he's frustrated with you? Yeah. I mean don't get me wrong, he's supportive. You know he really helps the family out financially. The love is still there. It's just you know the communication, it just hasn't been the same lately. So he is still extremely supportive. So that is a plus, right? And they just wish you guys could talk like he used to again get back to the way things used to be. Yeah. You know he's very supportive. It's just you know everything is focusing on the kids and other family. Make sure the kids are taken care of. Um I just feel like we could communicate like we used to ensure our feelings. So it sounds to me that you guys are more focused on making sure the kids get to school on time, that Cynthia makes all her appointments and she's well taken care of but you still feel he blames you and it's kind of hard to initiate a conversation. Am I right? Yeah. And I wasn't always like this and it was just after the situation with Cynthia and you know, you don't speak like we used to, you know, we had a good life, a great life actually just things have changed. Okay? So there was a point where you guys did get along relatively so sally I want you to do something for me, suppose you went to bed tonight and when you woke up tomorrow morning, a miracle supposedly happened, what would that America look like for you? A miracle. I think maybe that the communication problems with my husband would just disappear. Okay so what might your husband notice about you? That would be different. That would make him want to talk more. Well definitely see them happier. You know I wouldn't be so stressed. Um You know riding bikes, doing the activities that we used to do before um getting back to the US rather than you know mom and dad or husband, wife will be more togetherness. So it sounds like a problem could possibly be solved if you guys just started to communicate a little bit better. Um Yeah hopefully. Um I hope we get there one day but that's just one of my biggest problems. Um You know I struggle a lot with feeling guilty I guess shame about my daughter's um fetal alcohol syndrome. You know I just I feel like he's upset with me and I guess someone, I feel like I deserve it. Okay so what I'm hearing is um in addition to your marital conflict, Cynthia's F. A. S. Is being is very difficult for you. Could you express to me what that's like? Well yeah I tend to blame myself for Cynthia. She isn't developing the way she should from what the doctors have been telling me but you know it's very upsetting to me as a mother. I would never want that for any of my Children and it's just it's just way too much for me to handle. Well I understand that, that it must be extremely difficult for you. You know, your child is going through this and you're worrying about it being like your fault, right? You're feeling guilty about it. Yeah, I'm very disappointed, very feel so much guilt. Um I just wish things would change. My life is in shambles right now. So when you say your life is in shambles, what exactly does that mean? Um it's really hard on me right now. I know it's my fault, you know, I drank my pregnancy, there's no denying that. Um you know, I wish I didn't really hard on me because I know if I didn't drink with Cynthia's that none of this would happen and she would have, you know, normal development just like either. So I know you're feeling remorseful about all that has happened and you wish you could take it all back. I do, because I love her enough to stop drinking and I feel like that I'm a good mother and a big book getting there again. So what I'm hearing is, you know, you're really not as bad as you may think, um you managed to make all the senses appointments as well as keep your household together and that's very commendable, but I don't know, I feel like I'm a good mother, but you know, I'm really not what mother would drink, you know throughout her pregnancy, who would do that to her child? It's understandable why you feel the way you feel and it's a very difficult time for you right now and you know, you have a lot going on the way on the world is pretty much on your shoulders right now, but you need to give yourself some credit and I don't think you're I don't think you're bad, bad, okay, not thinking about that. The fact that you came in today show some form of motivation and that's called taking the first step to making your life better. Um I know you left India and you shouldn't have to go through this, but you do have other Children in the home. Tell me a little bit about john Jr and Maria and how they're handling this, john Jr he's a great help. He helps you know with everything. He kind of reminds me of my father and he has the compassion I see in him a lot and the risk the same way she helps a lot with Cynthia that's beautiful. He really raising Children up. Yeah, they both be really good in school. That says, you know, they're on track with their development and No, no struggle to be honest. I don't even know how I manage, you know, raising them that well in the midst of everything going on in my life. You really should be extremely proud of yourself because I know it's overwhelming with all you are going through? um let me ask you, what is your greatest motivator you wanting to be? So, it's got to be my kids. My kids are my whole life. If it wasn't for them, I don't know where I would be. So definitely my Children, that's that's my biggest motivator. That's the reason I'm here today. So it sounds like you are very optimistic and I'm so very proud that you really did take the first steps to be here today. Yeah, I do feel very determined to stop using alcohol. My family's welfare is extremely important to me. So let me ask you sally what, how is it that you came to this decision to stop drinking? Something just needed to change. You know, my life has been going downhill, It seems I wake up with headaches in the middle of the night, it's just it's not good for my health. So it sounds to me like if you stop drinking your physical health and your mental health would improve. Um Yeah, no doubt, I feel like my drinking is the biggest issue that I have to deal with at the moment. Um You know, it's not the only one, but it's the main one. So you mentioned that you tried to stop drinking um several times before, can you tell me a little bit more about that? Of course. So I've been in treatment um in the past a few times, um I've been rehab twice, I just kept going back to alcohol. And so when you, when you went back to alcohol, was there anything in particular that that caused you to do that? Um No. Um No, really, I mean, I don't recall, you know, there's just a lot going on in my life between Cynthia. Um You know, my father passing mostly. So when you say treatment, you're talking inpatient or outpatient um both for inpatient treatment for 28 days, I did do an out patient um with counseling after that. Um It was a little bit ago. And what were those experiences like, you know, it didn't work out for me. I felt like the people that I was dealing with, they were mature very young. I just didn't feel comfortable. And you know, that's why I asked you in the beginning, I was curious about your age is just because of my experience in the past. I see. So that made you a little uncomfortable. So I just want you to know that it's not unusual sometimes for a client not to feel a connection with a therapist, but that doesn't mean that they have to end their relationship. So what I'd like to propose in our counseling relationship is that if you feel that way or you know, you're uncomfortable for some reason that you talked about and discussed it. Yeah, I could definitely do that. Okay, good. So it sounds like you really want to be sober? How long would you say it's been since your last drink? About a month or so? Okay. And what have you been doing to help yourself not drink? Honestly, I just don't drink. You know, some days are harder than others. So on a scale from 0 to 10, 0 being that you really, really want to have a drink and 10 being that you have no desire? What would you say you are a scale probably have four. What's different on the days that you didn't drink compared to the days that you did? What would you say? Um, on the days that I didn't drink, I feel happier, Me and my husband communicate better and then you know, better able to deal with everything going on with my life, especially with Cynthia's fetal alcohol syndrome? You know, I think it's really remarkable that you've been able to find something deep down inside yourself to say, you know, I'm tired of this and I want this to stop and you know, to make that decision. I think part of what is happening is that you're realizing you're not a victim, that you are strong, you are a survivor and you have the resilience to overcome this.\":(\" We're getting close to the end of the session was there were a couple of things I wanted to discuss, but first was there is there anything that you can think of that you want to know?\",\"Reality-self\"),\n",

So so far today we've talked about Cynthia's F A. S. T about the about the difficult difficulties in communication and marriage. Um There's two other things that I wanted to talk about and one would be growing up um with your mother as an alcoholic, practicing alcoholic and the effects of that moment and on you. It's possible that could contribute to question. I don't know. But I want to export the other thing that we really haven't talked a great deal about was passing to your father, which I know has been very difficult.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",

Like maybe we could do this, maybe we could do that. She was always very quietly involved in planning and the exception for which would be the dinner table. My mom tolerated no fighting at the dinner table and the only time I would ever hear raise your voice to be like eating dinner and and we all respected that my dad included.

So tell me more about your mom and you, How was that relationship growing up?\":(\" She was mom. I don't know. She was like demon my mom. Um it was super positive. I loved, I guess a big memory of me with her. I loved cleaning with her. Um it was like, that's funny to say because I'm talking about when I was like 15 or 16 teenagers hate cleaning anything at all. But I particularly like the living room and kitchen, like we, it was a chore of mine, like I helped vacuum or help do dishes or whatever. My mom and I always get together and it was always on Tuesday night because she had a small group from her church that came over on that night and so we would clean before I just talked and that was like a few hours, like really just me and her because my dad was still at work and And my brother was often something else. He never helped, but that was our time to like connect and we always had that for like five years, we had that. And so um and now as an adult, she passed about eight years ago, 2010. Yeah. And so I mean that was a big loss for me because we were close all the way through, like I moved away um and Boise now and I grew up in indiana but we would talk on the phone at least once a week. I mean she never stopped calling, I never stopped answering and she was always just to support and was never critical even when like, I don't know, even when my lifestyle changed a lot and I moved away, she was never ever critical of my decision, was always just excited that I was doing something I cared about and okay, yeah, when I met my wife Trina, she was ecstatic.

Something about either the way that you respond to the things that I say or like the way or just the time that I have to explain something because that's something to where like sometimes I feel like with Trina like or with a friend or whatever, I don't feel like I have enough time to fully explain myself when I'm talking about an issue and so it it just builds and I don't get it all off and it's nice to have the space in here and you don't judge me the same way other people do, which has been nice, I guess.

So what I'd like to do today, given this is our first time that we've met for supervision is if we could just leave the par to the side and we'll get back to it now. I've allocated it now for this meeting. Is that okay? Yes. What I'd like to do is just go through my perspective of what supervision is and then look at how we might structure that time together and how we might evaluate that time together and talk to you a little bit more about your learning style etcetera. So I'll probably be a bit directive for about the next 20 minutes while we worked through that. Is that okay? Okay. Well I guess the first thing I want to know is have you ever had supervision like this before with a boss or a colleague or No.\":(\" It's all new.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",

        "                         \" why don't we talk about how you learn? So Journaling is something that you currently do? Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

So that could be something that you bring to supervision? Okay. You mentioned the part before, obviously I'm here to support you to achieve your learning goals but also to help you get that part together. So we might need to use our next couple of supervision times to work on that\":(\" with that if I'm feeling that I can't achieve everything in my part and that there might be something in there that I could swap, am I allowed to change things through it as it\",\"Reality-self\"),\n",
        "                         \" goes? Look yeah, it should be something that's organic that we can tweak. The only problem with changing too much of it is that we need to obviously measure how you're going halfway through and then at the end so there needs to be quite a bit of consistency so that we can evaluate it against what you were doing halfway through placement. But yeah, sure if there are tasks that you've set for yourself and you just think I'm not going to get to them. But there might be something similar that you think I could get to that then a little more than happy and encourage you to to make those changes. Um So it's a matter of working out your learning goals whether that use past specific or learning goals on top of your path, that's what we'll do in supervision or address those. Now again my preferred option is that you come with an agenda and I've got a pro former for an agenda. Why do you think I'd be suggesting that you come thinking about? Okay what do I want to get out of supervision\":(\" I guess because if I came with nothing then we wouldn't have anything to talk about.\",\"Reality-self\"),\n",

But yeah, in terms of goals. I mean, funnily enough, one of the things I've been thinking about just in terms of how we're going with family and relationships just talking about kids before is I've just kinda been realizing how much of the time when I'm home in the lounge room or with family, if there's not something going on specific at that moment, how much I kind of just pull out my phone and you know, just, you know, the kids might be playing or doing something, but my default is to kind of pull out my phone and like look at the news or look at facebook or look at sort of the NFL app or something like that. Um, and I guess, you know, almost just become a default behavior and I've been thinking about that and kind of thinking, well instead of that, I could be like building a tower or reading a book or engaging with kids and so I've just been thinking about me as a parent in that sort of space? Bit of concern that I do want to be present for my kids and so a bit of a goal I've been thinking about is I kind of want to change that behavior a bit unless in that, so I can be a bit more present with my family':('just even from the few times that we've caught up that that your families, it's probably the most important thing to you that you always come back to','Reality-other'),\n",

You kind of have those down spots And also like at the end of the day when you're tired from work where I'm tired from work and stuff like that, it's kind of easier you're looking for something to do that doesn't actually involve you kind of entertain your mind without actually requiring any effort kind of thing.

I've done a little bit of working in a travel agents worked at a local swimming pool when I started I started just like I was at university and I left. I went into the job market straight away.

You know, if you have the support, I was lucky, I had someone support me there within the airline. So what I would do for you today, you would just see me as somebody who would be there by the side to help you to climb up that ladder by meeting people getting your CV done correctly and all those things.

Yes, and the second one you need to fill out at the end of the session, it would have all your details on it, we will communicate by email or my mobile phone, you would have to complete your CV. Just bring what you've got, we'll walk through it so that we can profile your CV according to the job that you want to apply and then start to start applying for jobs, but we will meet next month at the end of the month, you know, like we just did at the time, so I'll get that CV CV done, then I'll get that straight away and then we can bring that in and start to work in the first scenario we're covering, sort of, the introductory stage. So the mentor and the mentee are starting to build the rapport between themselves, that they'll discuss the ground rules, how they can be contacted, where the location of the mentoring sessions will start to take place and it may be that some sort of initial career aspirations have started to be drawn into the equation, this is what','Reality-self'),\n",

But what if it was true? Like what would that mean about my life and what I could even amount to and what kind of legacy would I leave behind if that was true? And everybody has different fears for different reasons. Some people's core belief is, I'm incapable, you know? And that to them is paralyzing like man, if I wasn't capable, like that could ruin my life. And it's not that they actually believe they're incapable, but it's just like, oh my gosh, if that was true, the consequences to my life would be devastating and I wouldn't even be able to tolerate it. And so this is sort of what we're working with. And I always say when we get to a core belief doesn't necessarily have to be your core belief. But let's, let's work with it. Let's see if it is part of this is sort of like hypothesis testing. Like let's work with that and see if that could be true for you. When people have core beliefs, they usually then have conditional rules and assumptions about how the world will work and how they should act within that world. So what I mean by this is when you have such a core belief, like I'm worthless or I'm unlovable. There will be certain things that you believe are scripts that you have to follow in order to have any semblance of emotional safety or to prevent yourself from having that core belief come true. And so we're going to talk about what some of those things could be for you when somebody has a worthless core belief, what might that do in terms of your expression of your needs and wants to other people?

So um we can kind of direct what it is that I would love for you to notice as I coach Arora. So I do coach from an I. C. F perspective, which to me means that I'm focusing on the person, not necessarily the problem. Why is it that this smart, creative, whole resourceful person is having difficulty to resolve to get where she wants to go. So yes, we do have to have a goal. We have to have a definition destination. So we know where we're going, but it's about more about being present. So I want to put some of the stereotypes to rest about, you know, I. C. F. Coaching. It's not all questions. Um coaching in our definition is a reflective inquiry process. So you're gonna notice that I use reflective techniques is as much as questions that I summarize that I just, I want a roar to hear what she's saying so she can stop and think about it because it's more about holding up the mirror, how can I best do that so she can see you know what's going on with her in a way that she can objectively understand it instead of being caught in it in her head. And so at times I may give information, information is not the same as giving solutions and and that's okay. Um I use a lot of closed questions um to help clarify, but I think the main thing is that she feels safe with me, safe to share what's on her mind, um what's going on with her and that I'm just, you know, receiving what she's giving me and giving it back to her to see if we can't understand it better that will help her to move forward. So sometimes in coaching, you know, your client just needs a sounding board to talk things through. I've had clients where I hardly say anything but just ask a question every now and then, um and just clarify if that's what's helpful for them. Um So they can see new options, but but in particularly when your client is circling, resisting going down side roads and getting stuck in their thinking, which we all do and then it really is about coaching the person. So they can, you know, see through that that thing that's getting in their way, they need to discover what's blocking them so they can determine what's next. So I always say in this type of coaching, you're there thinking partner, you're not, that's why I say you're not doing it for them, you're helping them, again, this smart, this creative, resourceful person to think through what's getting in her way of getting what she wants. So um when I we're going to focus today on the reflective process because I think it's most misunderstood and in the I. C. F. Competencies it's one of my favorite is direct communication and I think it's really misunderstood. It's not about challenging. Although it may feel that way. It's not critiquing. It's not advising. It's not pushing. Um It's an interesting thing. The word direct has so many biases and misinterpretations. You know I teach a lot in asia and they're like well we're not direct but it's not about you know getting in someone's face. It's just about again about sharing. It's really about reflecting what you see what you hear what you notice and a lot of you know I teach a lot about how to open your heart and your gut. So it might be sharing what you're sensing. Um And you could be wrong. That's okay if I'm wrong. I'm sure Aurora will tell me and then she'll tell me what it really is for her and that means we're going deeper. So um it's the reflective process that I really feel is so valuable and I'd love for you to to really notice what I'm noticing how I share with her receive what she's giving me and give it back to her. You know some people say but isn't that interpreting well it is sometimes hard to to not interpret what you're sensing and like I said, that's in a sense, we don't want to push them into. No, no, I think you mean this, but you offer it, you know, I think this is what's going on. What do you think? And then let them tell you what it really is. So, I will often use the words I noticed I heard I sent um let me see if I've got it right. Um so this is what you're telling me. So you're gonna hear me say that a lot. So again, I'd like you to, you know, listen for that. So, um what am I reflecting? I'm reflecting what I see because I get a chance to see her. Although most of my clients and and and arora was my client years ago. I can't even remember like what it was like 10 years ago or something 48, 8 years ago. Right? But but we was always on the phone. So getting to see you as a luxury. But you can still hear patterns and emotionally charged statements shifts. The shift is always the key. If there's a shift in an emotion, there's something going on and you want to be very curious about that as best as you can though. Use their words that will keep you from too much interpretation. Use their words and just share what you notice and try not to add in your opinion and your judgment and if I do that you can ding me on it. I'm really okay, so I'm really looking forward to the questions and and answers uh uh you know, see if I can answer your questions, see what you say, see what you saw and what I do know is there's many different ways to coach um and you may take a different path and you may hear something differently. That's great, please share that as well. Okay, so I'm going to turn my sharing off and there we are. So are you okay? Are you comfortable?

Or or it could be improved or sometimes uh in in in in the work, sometimes you just change your mind right. Um and the fact that you do it once and you feel entitled to being congratulated for finishing a task um that might not have been well done is what I find that sense of entitlement, like completing a task doesn't mean you've done it correctly or that it is the end. Um And you there's always room for improvement. And and in an agile world we need to change things along the way. So so sometimes it might be even my own unclear direction, which is sometimes what I tried to think about is what I wasn't clear um Exactly on on what it was needed. Um But the sense of entitlement comes on. I already did it, I did it. Um But what is the quality of that work is what I put into question and again it goes back into maybe my standards, my standards are this level and you know, and I even uh and I even made it make it explicit or clear, you know what the standards were and that's where sometimes I I think I could improve. Um But it does bother me at a. M at a basic level that first initial reaction if I already did it, you know, you really did what you asked me to do. So uh it's more about that that they're not meeting the standard that you appreciate, not that they want to be celebrated. I saw that you didn't like that.

Um like uh you know young adults uh just graduating from college and entering into entry level positions, I see this a lot. They need this constant reinforcement that they're doing a good job and I think it's fine to to do that, I guess for me going back to whether you want to call it values or something, it's it's a bit much for me to constantly be telling someone you're doing a good job or sometimes I even feel you are right, I think it's you know, it's your you're supposed to do, right?

The emotional stuff that they might need, that you would really just prefer them to be passionate about their work. It's sort of different. But yeah, I hear it overlaps.

Is there a way that you can separate your your judgment and bias which you said you had at the beginning that and only focus on the results. Is that something that is possible I think um is it is it possible to separate them? You've got to separate them because that's where you have goals and objectives and and how you measure people. So I think you need to measure people by by the outcomes of what they do. Um and I strongly believe that um I think to separate that out with the attitude towards work, right?

So you know, had she have said, I don't know um Yeah I guess this one I would have said then let's talk about the second one and see what that is. So I'm constantly monitoring her emotional responses to the things that I ask and what I do throughout the session and that's what I saw. Was it wrong in some cases? Yeah. You know, probably like I said if we had more time, I would have heard that, but I would bet 90 please that there was so much into in that in her description of that that that was a powerful thing she wanted to work through. So did I make the choice for her? Yeah. Would you I'd probably be dinged on the I. C. F. Confidence. Yeah, I didn't make an invitation outrightly but I did invite, you know, is this really the thing you want to work on or do you want to explore the second one? And she said no.

And linda asked steve the question, what is your experience of volunteering? Did you notice the energy shift and steve? When she asked that he went to his head, It almost sounded like he was reading his resume for his volunteer activities more so than what's his internal experience? The opportunity here, I think is to explore something that means something internally. To steve even mentioned the word commitment. So what might it have opened up if they had talked about commitment? What does commitment mean to you\":(\" shrinkage? Right, dwindling throughout the year? What is your desire now in terms of the amount of volunteer activities you engage in?

One opportunity here though I noticed is that linda asked a specific question. What is your desire now with relation to that hours essentially that you want to work. What if she had just stopped that? What is your desire now? Instead of moving to kind of the head space? The whole person space of what is your desire for the experience that you want? Seeing steve as home, resourceful, capable and creative? Let's continue\":(\" quality of the engagement and impact being the most important. Yes, I like the way you said that and then the time just flows from that. Mhm.

It's it's hmm it's paying back, as I say that it's like, well, okay, there's a balance sheet and there's uh debits and credits and uh there's there was, there was volunteering that I received early in my life from volunteer coaches, volunteers that contribute to, to where I am today that in mentoring and, and, and I want to give back, I want to, I want to make a difference in the community with people who are mhm Who are not expecting to pay for it. Mhm. It's like, it's almost a surprise. Um there's some gifting there were like when you go through the toll booth and the person in front of you has paid the toll. It's for you. Yeah, unexpected. Um Mhm, mhm no, no, there's no obligation on the other end. It's um, and yet I know there's a reciprocity there of of what I am giving will come back.

Talking about, I have many questions but I think the most important one right now is to ask you what outcome you want, what's the impact66 if the coach loses that preamble and just focuses on the question, what is the outcome you're looking for from this session, there are a couple of other choice points that can be offered here and again, there is no perfect coaching session, it is all just a series of choice points, but one is, we could have explored a little bit more around the session agreement. We have the topic and the outcome. One of the questions that comes up for me is what is the underlying, underlying meaning of the coaching topic for steve today? That is to say of all the things he could have brought to coaching today. Why is it this topic today? Why is it important to him now? Often that helps deepen the conversation to that internal experience for the client. Another choice point is that steve had just shared this worldview of reciprocity, there's an opportunity to explore that a little bit. Even before coming back to this session agreement, I almost felt like they were getting a little bit deeper and then popped back up to the session agreement.\":(\" Best way to get at that. Do you think that those qualities of the engagement you want? I think let's make a list. Okay. Oh boy. A list. I heard that. I like a list. Yes. Good, good. It never hurts to make a list.

            "                                          \" again there. So the coach asked a really beautiful partner in question at the beginning of this segment, She said, what's the best way to get at that, What I really appreciate about that is that she's not presuming the path and she's not feeling the responsibility of taking the client through a path? She's offering the client an opportunity to choose where to go next. This is a great example of seeing her client as home resourceful, capable and creative and a great example of partnering and then we see a little bit of levity as they laugh about the list and she's really mirroring the client's energy there. Let's see what happens next.\":(\" What are that attributes that I want in the engagement? I want an engagement where um where I can utilize my coaching skills. Mhm. I want an engagement where potentially I could mentor. Okay, I want an engagement. Where were the people that I'm engaging with? Um yeah, realize a positive difference in their life. I want an engagement where I look forward to it. Where it's fun where I don't know, this one may or may not stand less where there's some physical activity involved. Yes, become somewhat sedentary, not a desk time, right in the seat time. Yeah. So yeah. So, so where, where the engagement itself requires movement. Mhm. Mhm. Where there's learning on both sides? Ah mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah, that feels like equal exchange when you say that you know like part of systems theory where there's learning on both sides? Things I was curious about by the way this is a great list. Um came right up with it. The things I was curious about is your um your essence statement and your values as you look towards those in this context. Does anything come up for you that um stands out in that essence statement or those values that you, that might be qualities that you are looking for in an engagement. I don't know if I articulated it, There's there's um inspirational good one and that's on both sides that gets to the place of Yeah, looking forward to it, wanting to do it. I think that's that, that's what I would add to that list. Great. It's really a, it feels like a a real spiritual dimension to that inspirational, expanding the spirit. So this is a this is a meaty list I did and I'll be happy to share it as well. Um so you want me to read it back to you. Yes. And I can also, I'll also Yeah, exactly. I'll also type it up and send it to you so make sure you've got it. But you want to utilize your coaching skills. Just try and stop you, right? You want to mentor, you want the people that you engage with uh to be in the space where they realize a positive difference in their life. Mhm. You want to look forward to the experience of this volunteerism and have fun and you want to move around. You wanna be gay engaged with something that requires some movement and not just being really static or stationary. You want that reciprocal uh exchange, learning happening on both sides.

The lightness really show some trust and authenticity between the coaching client. One thing I did notice as well is that we went from this recapping of the list two, what's next? Which is a fine question to ask. And I think there was an opportunity to deepen the learning around that list a little bit, perhaps asking steve now that you said that out loud, how does that feel or what have you learned about yourself and listing out these these qualities and attributes? What might have been possible if that had been deepened? Just a little bit.\":(\" I don't know right now linda. I think that I think that there's yes, there is some some uh some place of measure of success around the impact that I want to cause. Um and I noticed myself going well if I came to the conclusion that homelessness was the impact that I wanted to cause a lot that I want to do away with. And and and yeah, and so there was a place of uh really this here comes the commitment part. And um so so so I have not thought in very much detail or about the impact that I want to cause.

And then we see that we have two coaches together, right? Because he asked himself the question, what does better mean? And I love again the lightness and the relationship that we see here linda also artfully acknowledge the emotions she noticed in steve which is often the point of some big insight. And there is a choice point here as well which is to check in with a client and ask steve what is happening for him right now linda also artfully acknowledged a motion that she saw within steve which led to an insight for him. And she acknowledged that by saying that's powerful steve. So giving him some affirmation around that insight and there's an opportunity to take that inside a little bit deeper. Anytime you notice that there's something powerful, it may be useful to ask the question of what is happening for you now, now that you have that insight or what do you want to do with that insight? One other noticing I had in this section, maybe you noticed it too. I noticed linda taking a lot of notes here. It brings to me a question of simply what does the impact of breaking that eye contact looking down at the paper And writing notes have on the relationship at that point moment. Might she be missing some visual clues by taking notes. Taking notes as a personal preference. So I invite you to consider what is really important to take down and what can you leave off of the paper so that you can focus and be present with your client. Mhm.\":(\" What does being intentional about it do for you? Well, um first thought that causes it to happen. Yeah. Uh so the quality of the experience is significantly um so back to the quality of the engagement. Yes, that list of things materialize as a result of being intentional that come to be hmm hmm Yeah, it's good. And I was just gonna ask, we're getting close to the end. Just gonna ask if there's anything else it feels um from your non verbal and verbal that there's a place of settling here. Um is there anything else? So the what else before me is is that I want that list. I will get it to you right after we finish here. I wanna I wanna take that list. I wanna um with the impact of bringing generative homeless to all my interactions. What then are opportunities that put those two together?\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",

Beautiful internal question focused on the client. The coach also noticed the settling that she sensed. So she did notice what was happening in the field with the client. And then she followed up with what else, what else do you need? And steve started listing some action items. Now since there was some time pressure here because they both mentioned the time. But despite that I think there was an opportunity to really anchor some of the insights from this session. It may have been something as simple as you mentioned that you wanted to focus on these attributes and qualities of volunteer opportunities. Where are we with that? Or it could simply be, what have you learned about yourself in this session does really take that learning to the next step and helps bring a natural closure to the session as well. One other choice point is after listing those action items might have been an opportunity to check in with what support do you need to see this through or what accountability do you want? That helps deepen the learning and forward the action.\":(\" Yeah. Um I wanna gosh, I want to really acknowledge you um for you know, the the generative wholeness way in which you are approaching this question, you know, to really think through um what your interests are and what you want to have happen from the experience before looking for a particular place to go and to volunteer, you know, to search for those qualities and understand what it is that's important to you as you express yourself and make an impact. So really acknowledge you for that. I yes, I think it's a approach that um I could recommend to some of my clients as they talk about these things. You know what I mean? Yes, I do. Because a lot of people that I speak with are engaged in volunteer activities and struggling whether they want to put their energies in those places anymore. So thank you for that. You gave me a real gift. So I'm realizing here you're welcome and I realized that this is the I am model. Yes and I almost said that earlier because it is intention.

We're largely talking about drugs such as psilocybin, magic mushroom juice uh or GMT, which is generally now used as ayahuasca. These are serotonin ergic agonist drugs which produced quite a classical psychedelic states that reported famously, of course, under the influence of mescal in by Aldous Huxley in his book the doors of perception. There's also some debate as to whether ketamine or s ketamine, these good dramaturgical antagonists which are now being used for depression, a psychedelic, certainly they do produce changes in brain activity, rather similar to the the serotonin ergic drugs, but they're not subjectively quite the same. But it may be that they both work in a sense, in the same way to have their clinical effects.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \"Right? So the word psychedelics and hallucinogens are they sort of used interchangeably?\":(\" They often are. Yes. So people often talk of the serotonin ergic hallucinogens like LSD or psilocybin. Ayahuasca, um psychedelic was a term that was developed by Huxley to explain the effect, which is mind revealing. And that in itself is a very interesting choice of words, greek words because it's that's kind of what we are using them for now. We're not using them for the hallucinations, which is often seen negative, although many people find them quite pleasant, the particular visual hallucinations. But the purpose of using these drugs is to have to make changes in the way people understand themselves and to disrupt, Let me use them clinically, we're trying to disrupt maladaptive patterns of our behavior and in fact just, you know, jumped the gun a bit, but when we look to when we're using psilocybin as we've been doing that, we've done two trials of psilocybin for depression resistant depression. And and mine revealing is quite important because there are two elements to this. The first is that depressed people when they go through the trip, they often see the reasons why they're depressed for the first time in maybe ever. They've understood why they're depressed. They can reveal the nature or some of the at least the factors which lead to depression. And of course the other thing is about them is that they can open the mind to new solutions so people can think differently. People can sometimes come to terms with their abuser for instance, in a trip and actually get closure. I prefer the term psychedelic to hallucinogenic.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \"Um Now LSD um was initially I think um sort of discovered in 1938 somewhere around there and in the 19 sixties had a had a significant sort of focus, you know, highlights. Um and I think tim leary, the Harvard professor, quite charismatic, talked about young people to sort of Turn in and sort of drop out and you know, go against convention. Um and from what I understand in the 1960s there was this resurgence with lots of research papers, large number of trials, international conferences and psychedelics were present the question, what happened afterwards?\":(\" Well, as with all great developments, politics got in the way it was the Vietnam war that these drugs were seen and were being a revolution in psychiatry and clinical neuroscience and then the Vietnam war was going badly. People american young americans were opposing the war. People will be caught up at the age of 18 depending on whether their birthday ended an order and even number they could be sent to this country that we've never heard of to fight an enemy they'd never see for a cause they didn't understand in a place that was disgustingly hot and full of mosquitos and they didn't, you know, for the first few years they went innocently thinking they were going to change the world and then info came back. People came back, the bodies came back, the broken, you know, the invalids came back and then the war started challenging the purpose of the war. It was not only destroying american men but it was also destroying an awful lot of south asian women and Children as well. So the war antiwar protest started and some of the potential soldiers escaped to Canada. Others went to san Francisco. LSD was becoming used now in more in art and in music and it was LSD was seen as fueling the anti war movement. Of course it wasn't but it was an excuse to get the drug band and so they were bound then and they've been basically banned and they're still bound. Now there's no country in the world where LSD is a legal drug hmm\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \"interesting. So when we you touched on briefly sort of the mechanism of of action. But if we had to go a bit deeper as psychiatrists as mental health professionals to understand in terms of receptors um how do psychedelics act? Yes.\":()    \n",
            "                                          \"So let's so let's focus completely now on the on the clinical you use ones which are psilocybin, magic mushroom juice and ayahuasca which is D. M. T. Juice. So ayahuasca just so everyone understands D. M. T. Is a very short acting serotonin ergic psychedelic. The effect lasts about five minutes. The if you and if you give it intravenously if you take it it doesn't work orally. So so the only way to use it orally is in this combination called Ayahuasca and ayahuasca is a combination of a plant that has D. M. T. In it and a plant that makes a mon away min oxidase inhibitor. So psychiatrists know about those but this one is called harmony and it's not a clinical one but it comes out of a plant. So you drink a tea made of the to the harm align, prevents the breakdown of the D. M. T. And the liver and the gut. So the D. M. T. From the stomach can go through into the brain. So D. M. T. Is a you know it's a a serotonin ergic and psychedelics like psilocybin and both of those. Now there are clinical trial data with both those drugs. So how do they work? Well they stimulate their agonists at the five HT two A receptor. And that receptor is a very interesting receptor for humans and for psychiatry because the human brain has more of those receptors than any other brain evolution In primates and other species has shown that the human brain is particularly endowed with these five HT 2 a receptors. So what are they there for? Well there aren't neurons which control cross cortical information as you probably know that the brain is essentially a A collection of billions 150 billion little computers. It's called a parameter cell. And the first level processing of everything in the brain is done by these parameter cells in cortical columns. But then the connectivity that pulling together things like seeing, hearing, thinking that's done by these the layer five pyramidal cells. They they they integrate brain function to make the brain the amazing organ it is. And those cells having are very well endowed with the two A receptor. We don't know why we have theories and I'll come back to that later if you want. But those are very densely the receptors are densely expressed on these layer five pyramidal cells. When you stimulate those receptors with say psilocybin, you dramatically change the function. In fact you you effectively you disrupt across cortical communication and that breaks down the ongoing patterns of neural activity which are underpin everything we do and that is why the psychedelic state is a very different state. That's why people feel differently. They often they feel that their bodies are changing. They often feel that they floating out into space. They often go to new other universes or other dimensions because the normal control of your brain is broken down and it's in that state when you disrupt typical classic, you know, your traditional day by day, minute by minute ongoing thinking that you can think differently. And that is the mind revealing aspect of of the psychedelic.\"\n",
            "                                          \"coming to um psilocybin, you have touched on psilocybin. What would be the current indications for psilocybin? The current landscape?\":(\" Well it's interesting because it's I mean so we now there are there are open trials uh in tobacco smoking helping people quit some the matt Hopkins matt johnson stuff from johns Hopkins. There's an open trial by Michael boudin shoots in helping maintain or reduce maintain abstinence or reduce alcohol intake in alcoholism. There's our open trial in resistant depression and a very small trial. So there's 4 4 trials of psilocybin in four different disorders you might say well what what brings it in? How can it work in addiction and depression? And I think this is where the neuroscience is particularly exciting because it's the in each of these cases almost certainly it's the same disruptive process. So what does that tell us about the disorders? Well these disorders are, the way I interpret these data is to say that these are all internalizing disorders in depression. People are ruminating about past mistakes and failures and guilt in addiction. People are ruminating about the tobacco or ruminating about the alcohol. You know O. C. D. People are ruminating about cleanliness. So I think they're all internalizing disorders. They're all disorders that people resist. People don't want to be where they don't these thoughts happen but they can't stop them and psychedelics disrupt them And uh you know let me get one of the, perhaps the greatest insight that Huxley produced in the doors of perception. He said, well, what happened? I took masculine, he said, and my mind opened, I understood things, my mind understood things that had never understood before. My mind was effectively released and then he went on to make the logical conclusion. That means something is constraining my mind. What's that? Well, the only thing that can be is the brain. So he said, the brain is an instrument for focusing the mind and psychedelics break down that ability. And that's what we've shown in the brain scanning has actually shown that that's what happens. And so in these different conditions, people's brains are dominating their minds, They're getting locked into thinking they don't want to be locked into and we can just break down the brain, take away the brain's control, let the mind run free for a bit and hopefully come up with a new solution, a new approach. It is, it is quite remarkable. The tobacco data are really quite, really fascinating because when you talk to Hopkins and in fact, you can listen on the drug science website, you can listen to my podcast with him and he says, what, when you talk to people who've given up smoking, it wasn't that they reduce their consumption basically was all or nothing. 3/4 of the people in that study, they never smoked again. They just said, smoking has no interest to me at all, Like it has for most people who don't smoke, it kind of reframed them and put them away from, from ever ever thinking about smoking. So it was a kind of completely remodeling their, their affiliation with what used to be the love object. So that's where we are at present now, what's coming, what's happening? There's been too controlled trials in people in with end of life, anxiety and depression, both from the johns Hopkins group, one from the new york University group, they both show that they help people reduce anxiety and depression, which obviously commonly occurs when people are told they're gonna die. We've now completed and it's going to be published hopefully next month, the head to head, the first, head to head of psilocybin versus S Attallah prom, I think you're gonna find those results very interesting. And, and and I suppose in terms of the conventional drug development compass pathways in America and europe instead of a multi center study Of basically an efficacy and sort of Phase three efficacy study where you, what it is a sort to be stopped three. So where you have three doses one mg, which is placebo, effectively a 10 mg, a minute dose and a 25 mg, which is a kryptos. And I'm really looking forward to those results because I suspect they're going to show that 25 is very, very effective compared with one and 10 is probably going to have some effect, but not everything\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \"right. And I guess this fits in with the recent study which I understand you were a part of Robin Carhart Harris as well. And uh on on micro dozing. And I think just a few days ago where they attributed, I think the headline was very much about, you know, um the use of psychedelics being or the benefits of psychedelics being due to placebo experience. Would you like to sort of expand on on that aspect?\":(\" Sure. Well, so we did uh is an extremely the leader of of Dallas was the, it was his brilliant vision. He worked out how we could do self blinding. We couldn't, we were four years ago we had ethical permission to do a micro dosing study. So micro dosing for the, for the listeners, micro dosing is giving a sub psychedelic dose in fact really is, it should be a sub detectable dose. But some people do finally get some some small sense of alteration of consciousness or mood with it. So it's a very low dose and definitely a non psychedelic dose. And you take it usually there's a sort of regime you know, three or four days a week, a few days off. So, but no one's ever studied. We had permission four years ago to do an LSD micro dose and study. But the hospital and ethics committee said every single micro dose had to be given in hospital and people had to stay in for a whole day because the half life of LSD is like six hours and that was just too expensive. We could not afford to do it because of the controls. You know the fact that this is a Schedule One drug. So we went out in the community and we asked people who were actually micro dozing and we gave them envelopes so they could randomize between placebo hubs and and an LSD tabs. And and then and we collected the data and it turned out that About 90% of the effect of a micro doses what is expectation is zero. Now that's to my mind that's not you know that's fine. If you if you feel better taking placebo you know the adverse effects are likely to be pretty low. So that's fine by me but it encourages me and what we're doing which is using big bigger doses, it's single big doses to produce profound reframing of mental states. That's the way forward.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \"So when we think about micro dozing, you mentioned the doses of psilocybin sort of one mg 10 mg 25 mg where would micro dose fit in one?\":(\"It will be between one and 3.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \" So yeah I guess we're for anyone who's you know, you know tried to publish, we yeah, absolutely. I think it it takes a long time um with L. S. D. D. M. T. And sort of masculine. You did talk about Ayahuasca as well. So do these differ in terms of mechanisms or are there any sort of differences between the psilocybin aspects? Could psilocybin be interchangeably used with L. S. D. D. M. T, masculine.\":(\" Really important. They differ obviously they differ in terms of potency so it is really important that you understand the dose of what you're taking because LSD is said it's about 1000 times more potent than masculine. So you don't want to mess with that. Make sure you get a decimal point in the right place. That's the first thing. They all work through the two way receptor but they all have different interactions with other receptors which is why some of them. So for instance the mescal in causes a lot of vomiting whereas LSD doesn't. So we don't fully understand why that is. And the key difference though is in terms of the half life and that's the reason actually why we, one of the reasons we pioneered our research with psilocybin. You take it already. This is a 3-4 hour trip. It's very you know we know it's very safe millions and millions of people in youngsters in Britain were using the mushrooms and For decades and we know that you know there's no death. So we know it's very safe and same with LSD is very safe but then an LSD trip lasts for 12 to 15 hours which means for research purposes you have to keep people in the hospital overnight which means that that triples the expense and also for clinical practice that will triple the expense. So so psilocybin is much shorter acting in S. T. D. M. T. Is really short acting. So if you know in our scientific studies of D. M. T. We give it intravenously and I think you can probably give it intra muscular as well. So that's a shot. And people have a powerful transient trip which lasts about 10 - 15 minutes and then they come back. So and there was a very interesting scientific question now you know some people are saying well that's all you need if you're gonna just shake up the brain to get rid of depression maybe that's all you need. Just shake the shake up the snow globe and it will settle down in a different way. That may be true. I mean, if it is true, that's interesting. My own view is that it's probable That the longer trip for 2-3 hour trips inside of side and are going to be more useful to depress people because basically it's not about shaking up the brain, it's about getting into the brain processes of depression while the brain is shaken up. And that that's why we we now call this therapy psychedelic psychotherapy, because everything we do is done with the ambition of the person coming out of the trip and then engaging in psychotherapy. And so I and I find this really exciting because, you know, this is bringing together sort of cutting edge psychopharmacology with the potential for innovation in psychotherapy. And you know, I'm really keen that the two are two disciplines which often are fighting each other, can actually come back and start holding hands. Hmm.\",\"goal\"),\n",
            "                                          \"So when we think about psychedelic psychotherapy, what would a session actually look like if I were to sort of enter into session? What would the duration look like, What would the actual session look like?\":(\" So, yeah, really important. Let me explain the process that we are using in our clinical trials. So which is likely to be pretty similar to what ends up in clinical practice. And there are four key elements. The first is what we call the preparation session. So you have to explain to people what's gonna go on in the trip because most of them haven't had a trip and you have to reassure them that even if they feel they're going mad, they're not and that there will always be a therapist present and help them work out how best to deal with what are often very negative experiences. I just let me just dispel one myth. One of my senior colleagues said to me once, well, of course these people are getting over the depression. They're just having a fun trip. I said the trip might have been fun for you when you were young, but for these depressed people who've been, you know, often been traumatized and suffered for decades. The trip is not fun. It's a really hard thing to do. They're often they're often reliving, they do, they relive their trauma, they they come and so it's it's hours of really difficult psychological experiences. It's not fun at all. So that's and in the trip we don't do any psychotherapy. Were there were present if they need to talk if they want to talk if they want to have hands held, you know, they're very frightened. You know, we we we nurture them comfort them, you know, but we don't ever try to engage with them because, you know, we, even in our volunteer studies, we had this, you know, you say to them, okay now it's for two hours into your trip, will you please do this test. And one guy said, oh fuck off, I'm talking to God, you know, and you know, the point is, you know, when people that they are beyond anything that's relevant, you know, they don't care about whether you can seriously subtract seven. You know, I mean it's a different dimension of consciousness so we don't ever engaged because we don't know what we're going to get back. But you could actually just destroy. The person. Could be at the point of that insight and destroyed. So we never but after the trip we obviously reassure them and then the next day we have what's called an integration session and that's where they talk through with their therapists. Usually we have to but maybe you could do it with one, they talk through for several hours, the experience and then the therapist guides them to see what meaning there is in that and what learnings there are. And while insights there have been and in that process, in an ideal world that would have you go, you'd continue then for say six or eight weeks psychotherapy each week looking at those issues and trying to then use other, you know, whatever psychotherapeutic approach you're familiar or skill that to improve the long term outcomes in practice for the clinical trials, we can't do that. But but in clinical practice I think we will be able to get even better outcomes by that long term follow up psychotherapy.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \"Right? So I guess,\":(\" hang on, let me I want to qualify this, that the immediate benefit comes. So with the second trip with the taliban comparison, it may be we've got a floor effect. So the reason we did the second trip three weeks, the first was actually not necessary to get a better outcome because that's difficult when you've got a good outcome already. But to see if we could prolong the benefit that data, we're still collecting that data, We haven't got that data.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \" So when we're thinking about we've talked quite a bit about the psychedelic psilocybin. LSD. D. M. T. And fascinating stuff. M. D. M. A. I remember you talked about it when you come down to Australia to two years ago and you've previously talked about it as well. So M. D. M. A. From my understanding doesn't fit the description of a typical psychedelic but are showing quite a lot of promise within in psychiatry as well. Could you expand a bit on that?\":(\" Yes please. Um As you probably know, last week we published our first, the first ever study of M. D. M. A. In alcohol use disorder. And we showed again an open trial but to M. D. M. A. Sessions 125 mg two weeks apart as part of abstinence based alcohol therapy had an outcome which was infinitely better than our current therapeutic model. So with our current psychotherapy model, 80% relapse in six months. Just those two M. D. M. A. Sessions just inserted into the therapeutic model 20% relapse in six months. So this is a, you know, this is a remarkable, remarkable effect and why did we do it? Well, we did it for the same reason interestingly as we we did the psilocybin in depression. We did brain imaging studies. They showed what you pointed out already that M. D. M. A. Is not remotely like psychedelics, it doesn't change the cortical function the way the psychedelics does. But what it does do very powerfully suppressed the amygdala and the hippocampus. And we thought well that is why it's being used in PTSD because as you know, I'm sure all the psychiatrists listen to this know that the current preferred therapy of PTSD if if it doesn't respond to accessorize the therapy is exposure therapy It's prolonged effectively two or three hour exposure therapy allowing the patient to exhaust the emotion so that eventually the emotional resurgence which comes with the memory eventually extinguishes. And so it no longer perturbed their life. But many people cannot sustain that. And I started working on PTSD 1989. The reason I did that we did we did we started researching a a new tool for continuous noninvasive blood pressure monitoring. That was a level of our ability to monitor things in those days. And we started putting PTSD patients through it. And we discovered extraordinary instantaneous perturbations of blood pressure when they started to remember. And in those experiments we found people, you know, they were dissociated, faint or they just run out the room, you couldn't engage them in the therapy because the emotions just were so overwhelming and they were physiologically destructive. So you know, fast forward 30 years. We do you know we can see that M. d. m. a dampens down those reasons. So we thought well that explains why M. D. M. A. Works in PTSD. And then Ben caesar, who is a colleague of mine who who was a child psychiatrist and then he got disillusioned with that and moved into adult addiction psychiatry. He always said isn't it bizarre? You know I'm treating these abused kids and I'm loving them and we're all looking nurturing them as soon as they become adolescents, we put him in prison for being misbehaving misbehaving. You know this is wrong and he's right, it is wrong. Many, many alcoholics turn to alcohol to deal with trauma. So he said, well look why don't we deal with the trauma with M. D. M. A. And maybe they'll stop drinking. And that was what we did. And it was remarkable and now we're, you know, we're setting up a controlled trial to try to show that that was a real M. D. M. A. Effect and not just a kind of a prolonged exposure effect under M. D. M. A. Independent.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \" So with so M. D. M. A. P. T. S. D. Is well known. But for those listeners and viewers that aren't aware of the effect. Could you, could you expand on, you know, what is the actual effect with PTSD in terms of efficacy?\":(\" Well again this goes back to the classic work of the mithoff. They've done two trials now to controlled trials. You take people with PTSD, the first trial was resistant. PTSD, they failed on at least ss arise, they failed on CBT, They put them through a classical PTSD, you know psychotherapy program. I think there's was 18 weeks, 18 sessions talking about the trauma helping them to reframe their life etc etc. But twice in the middle of those, Those 18 weeks they gave them A single dose, the same dose is 25 mg of m. d. m. a. And during the trip they made them relive the trauma so that the emotions started to come back and they discovered that you could extinguish the emotions much better under M. M. D. M. A. So that after the trip they didn't have the flashbacks. They didn't have the the conditioned emotional reflexes which are the I mean the core problem of PTSD is not the fact that you had their legs blown off. You know it's a fact that every time anything not anyone makes a noise bangs the door you feel that you're being blown up again. And the emotions of that you actually believe you're in the instance of the explosion again and that is totally destructive to anyone's life. So extinguishing the emotional reflexes, Extinguishing those, those unwanted perturbations of consciousness is the critical solution. You never forget the trauma, but you can at least suppress the emotions it damage you.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \" Right? So if we think about, you know, there's lots of promising research, what's stopping this from sort of becoming mainstream.\":(\" Well they're all these drugs LSD psilocybin, ayahuasca and M. D. M. A. They're all illegal in all Western countries. So this research has been enormously difficult. It costs 10 times what it would cost in a sane world to do this research because of all the constraints I had to have a special safe to put my psilocybin with a camera making sure that when I take it out I don't slip it in my pocket and I say to the regulators, well why can't I just store it alongside the heroin I used for my other research. And they say, well, that's because heroin is a Schedule two drugs and this is a Schedule One drug. And I say, look, the reason I'm storing it is what people stealing it. If anyone breaks in, they're gonna steal the heroin, they're gonna steal the side of Simon. Come on. But the regulations have created this kind of monstrosity of bureaucracy, which is, You know, that's why virtually no one has done any research on these drugs for 50 years, because it's just too tedious and too difficult. And you gotta be you gotta be you gotta anticipate living a long time and be bloody minded like me to persevere with it. So we've got to try to change the rules. You know, the regulations serve no purpose. They don't protect people against recreational use. All they do is deny access of patients to this therapy.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \" Right? Yeah. So I guess the big question, I'm sure everyone's thinking is we've talked about the efficacy clearly very, very promising research side effects adverse effects. So, if we we, you know, the traditional sort of psychedelic aspect is these experiences, some of them sound like psychotic experiences. So the question is, what is the potential for adverse effects and in your experience, what have you noticed?\":(\" So yes, I can answer that in two ways. I can answer that from my experience, which is we don't ever put anyone into these trials who has been psychotic or who has a first degree relative who is psychotic or has been. And therefore we have seen no psychotic reactions And we've practiced. We've seen basically when you see the paper that's coming out in a few months you'll see apart from the trip itself which is there's a big debate is the experience of the trip an adverse effect or not. I mean I kind of say well of course it's not. You know. But then you know you could argue it well it might be. So anyway we report those. But after the trip you know there's no side effects. And that's one of the reasons many patients are looking for this therapy because they don't want to be on a daily dose of something which might affect their sexual function or increased weight or something. So so but we but much better than my experience. We go back to history. We can go back to uh the when these drugs were banned in 19 in the late 60s and the US and the U.N. the psychiatrists were very upset because they've done lots of work and many psychiatrists thought these were revolution treat. So there were analyses of thousands and thousands of treatments. And if you look at remarkable you know the rates of psychosis were lower. And you predict from normal therapy the rates of suicide were lower than you'd predict. And there were virtually no other adverse effects. So the evidence that these drugs are harmful when used in therapy very intermittently. You know, maybe twice in a lifetime. You know, the evidence of harm is that it's not there.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \" Right. So, so generally when we so I'm just sort of thinking in the future, if you know, a psychiatrist were to prescribe sort of psychedelic psychotherapy at some point, as we do with CSS RSR SnR, as we generally advise them of the potential for, you know, to take them regular withdrawal, sexual dysfunction at Kathy's emotional blunting etcetera etcetera. So, so what would be the top five or three side effects generally one would mention in psychedelic psychotherapy for patients that are undergoing therapy?\":(\" No, it's only the experience, only the experience of the only anything that lasts beyond the experience headaches. So quite a few people get headaches overnight and the next day they're kind of actually, that is quite an important point. Me groaners may get worse headaches, but you can use these drugs to treat severe migraines, like cluster headaches. So there's a paradox here and we don't it's that's probably got something to do with this desensitization that I talked about before. But in terms truly the only adverse effect that endures beyond the trip headaches. So you just warn people about that and you can take a couple of paracetamol,\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \"right. Um I remember sort of seeing. Um and this is one or two patients, I remember as a registrar um individuals that were using recreational drugs quite a lot, particularly ecstasy LSD um and magic mushrooms. And I remember these cases, two cases of persistent the realization depersonalization. Is is that something that, you know, is a potential risk? Or\":(  \" of course it's a potential risk? Absolutely, yeah. I mean, it is a potential risk, but I say everything is mitigated by the way we do it, but we know what we're doing, we know what does we're giving. We've got therapist presence. So, I mean, yes, you know, d realization depersonalization often associated with anxiety disorders and in some ways they are an anxiety disorder. And that's why we say, never don't go out into the Bush and take these drugs. You know, you know, we were looking at this is medical therapies, like the same way as you say, well, you wouldn't encourage someone to go out in the bush and start taking opium to deal with their pain. You know, you you this is we're looking at therapy, powerful therapy, recreational use, I wouldn't encourage because of the potential homes. But you know, that that we shouldn't be banning, we shouldn't be trying to eliminate recreational use by banning medical use. That's all I would say\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                           \" is there is there a risk? Or do you foresee or I guess, you know, the government's um I wonder whether they sort of are particularly worried about this aspect is, you know, is it possible that the approval of psychedelics for medical purposes? Is it possible that that actually leads to an increase in casual recreational use? Because kind of people kind of go, well it's for treatment therefore, you know, I guess we could use lots more of it. I wonder,\":(\" well all I can say the best example we have, where that hasn't happened is cannabis. You know, I mean medical cannabis hasn't led to a recreation. I mean of course there is a worse example I suppose which is previous medical use of opiates in America. But you know the american medical systems can predispose to problems. But cannabis and opiates are different from psychedelics as you take them every day. So there is a scope for diversion. No one is going to be taking home a psilocybin tablets. They cannot there won't be diversion. And that means it's very very unlikely that there's going to be any slippage from medical prescribing into recreation?\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",

So I guess if we were to think about like with any innovation, we've got, I think with technology, they often talk about this innovation graph, you know, the innovation trigger the peak of inflated expectations, then we've got the trough of disillusionment, the slope of enlightenment and the plateau of productivity. Where would you put psychedelics on that graph for you know, currently, where would you put it?\":(\" So that's a really lovely question. So me, in my research, we're definitely on the upward curve. If you look at investors, they're way ahead. There's an absurd, absurd amount of hype about psychedelic therapy. I mean, all the money that in the States and Canada that has been made of the cannabis boom is now moving. So, you know, I'm I'm kind of hesitant about this massive enthusiasm for for psychedelics as a as a way of making money. But I think certainly were on the rising phase of them as being a therapy,\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",

So if I had to you know, sort of if we had to sort of predict or foresee when do you think psychiatrists potentially might be in the position um of actually prescribing psychedelic psychotherapy?\":(\" Well that'll be quite soon. The bigger challenge it is going to be what the challenge we have met in your country and in my country with medical cannabis, it's not that the drug it's not the medicines work but doctors won't prescribe because doctors aren't educated, doctors don't like the idea that these things have come up in a different way from patients often. So the biggest limitation is going to be dr education which actually I think is why this interview you've just done is spectacular because we've gone through everything all the issues that doctors confront me with when they're trying to find reasons not to think positively about this treatment but its medical education and and psychologist I think even a bigger I think psychiatrists probably gonna be more open minded. But as you know psychologists often get stuck into therapeutic ruts. You know the big battle between CBT therapist and behavior. It's the same thing but they spent 30 years arguing with it. You know we need to get psychologists interested because optimizing the psychology is gonna be harder than optimizing the pharmacology. We've almost kind of optimist that already now so we need psychologists optimizing the therapeutic interventions that they give plump.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                           \" Okay so I guess we're coming to the to the end of the interview. This has been absolutely fascinating. Um I'd like to sort of end with you know what would be your three most important points? Of course you can give us more. But what would be the three most important take home message is for psychiatrist and mental health professionals when it comes to you know psychedelic psychotherapy or psychedelics and psychiatry mm.\":(\" Well the first is that certainly psilocybin and M. D. M. A. Are going to be proven therapies in psychiatry within a few years. That's the first point. The second point is I believe they're going to revolutionize many aspects of psychiatry and I hope psychiatry will embrace them because if it doesn't then we're going to go through this period of years, maybe decades where patients suffer. Let me let me give you a little um some I've done a little bit of arithmetic before LSD was banned in 1967 in America. The U. S. Government had funded six trials of LSD one or two doses for alcoholism recently. Some Norwegians reviewed in a meta analysis of that data and they came up with an effect size of one. So it's twice 2.5 times that of a campus eight. So this is the biggest effect size ever seen in alcoholism now in the 50 odd years. It's it's that these drugs have been banned. I've estimated over 100 million people worldwide have died prematurely from alcohol misuse If LSD only helped 10% of them. That's 10 million lives premature death saved. That's the kind of number that psychiatrists should be thinking about. The opportunities for these drugs to change the whole life trajectory of patients is enormous and but it won't happen unless psychiatrists get interested in it and at least try it out. Yeah.\",\"Reality-other\")\n",

So I was just really keen and then basically a lot of things happened where a lot of things came together, where I kind of, I was working for my levels and then that was stopped and um I was kind of not doing much like waiting for my gap year to start. Um and I was a little bit of an idiot and I kind of thought I deferred my place to university and I hadn't and I realized that about I realized that when they rang me in fresh this week and said, why haven't you registered? So I kind of ended up with like, no university place. Yeah. Um so a lot of things happened and, you know, my my partner now wife, I went to university, I end up following her to Dublin, but she'd gone off, so it's just massive life changes. And it I just, basically I had this, I mean, it feels like it has a very quickly, but when you look back there are a lot of warning signs for a few weeks that I wasn't quite right. Um had a really exciting gig in a band I was in and I was lots of ideas and energy, but it really kind of came to a head where I had saved up some money just kind of working a job doing breakfast shift in the hotel. And I went to a friends who had loads of this because I've always been a bit musical and he had loads of musical equipment loaded like recording and sense and stuff and I remember we just make music, I've got a few 100 quid saved, maybe I could buy this. And literally over the course of that night it went from, I'm gonna buy myself a bit of recording equipment for my computer to, I'm going to set up an international business empire with like a recording studio and restaurants and bars linked and it's going to be international. And I mean those days are a bit of a blur, but I know that I met people if I hadn't seen from school, I hadn't seen for a while, they were going to be my executive, something was offering people on the street a job I rang up, the bank was trying to speak to them about alone, luckily I, I was put in hospital before I actually had that meeting. Um, yeah, I just, it's completely escalated and you know, it was really just intense, kind of didn't sleep. So my family ended up, my parents going to realize something was wrong. So I ended up kind of getting, yeah, taken into hospital really. Um, his actions, but, you know, I could have been, if I hadn't have gone willingly, but still, it was very much like I was there still writing out my business plans and all of this stuff. It didn't the penny didn't drop for a long, long time. So I was really, you know, manic, I was in hospital when unfortunate, that's the only time I've been in the hospital. Um you know, my my partner came over and fresh this week and um it was really difficult. My so called the teachers that you just pack him to visit me in the world. Um I was kind of their go really interested in. I saw a clinical psychologist when I was discharged, which was really helpful trying to make sense of what happened. Um So it took a good few months to cover. I ended up having my gap here. Um I kind of thought it was a one off really. Um So I went to university in Dublin and I started and it was all going well and I found my love and I embraced my g side psychology and then kind of in there was one point where I felt like I was taking on too much and I felt a little bit like my mind was racing and I remember just speaking to one of the doctors but it was okay. I was really into my final year when things really escalated and again, a trigger for me with lots of life changes and boredom. So I've been doing loads and loads of, I've been working as a support worker and getting my station up and running and research system and lots of stuff um tendency to buy more than I can chew. Um and then that all stops and things really calmed down and I started my mind started racing. I had loads of energy again. And yeah, the irony, this is why I start talking about how it relates to my career. Um I got I literally got some hyper manic about my dissertation about hyper main. Yeah.\":(\" Yeah,\", \"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \" I really did. Um remember my supervisor, this is a really niche topic he's got here uh interesting and I haven't really told anyone at that point, you know, my close friends knew and my my my family knew but I wasn't so I told some people I wasn't too open about it. It's kind of neat to know that that was the first time I really thought God this might actually be this isn't a one off is it? And at that point I saw a psychiatrist and they were like, you know, you've had to Manic episodes. So you know we'd say you're bipolar. Now, looking back, I definitely had one when I was 16 as well. Um It just wasn't picked up at the time, you know how festival had this ridiculous business idea and didn't sleep and I injured myself but I was still, You know at a festival. He was yeah, so in retrospect, it's definitely been there since about the age of 16. Um So yeah, it kind of was on medication, it kind of settled down a little bit and now I graduated started my assistant. So I called this job um ironically my first kind of supervisor when I was a research system, uh knew my parents. Um He's a clinical psychologist and he knew my parents and he was actually at my mom's 50th birthday party when I was on leave in the psychiatric ward to go to my mom's 50th. Um So I remember seeing him and I was you know, I was really not, well they let me go out for a few hours which was really kind of them but I was you know, still really high as a coat and I remember him saying how you're doing and everything and he was my supervisor and we never mentioned it, I never thought about it and I look back now and I go that's strange. I remember even we were away for like a conference and they were saying something, there was four of us sitting around the table and someone said something about one in four people apparently has a mental health problem. I was just like going this is my moment, say it, don't say it, don't say no what if he was back? Um I never discussed it with him, which seems a bit strange. Um But yeah, so I was kind of the game carried on my career towards um clinical psychology and I started being interested in bipolar disorder and doing little bits of research and publishing bits kind of about bipolar disorder, hyper mania, that kind of thing. Um And interestingly, throughout my career it's not been the big life events like getting married and having Children, having made me unwell, it's very much life events related to my career, really push on that failure, but um you know, not good enough, those are the ones that seem to get me. So, it's very much related to my career, like I was saying, so dramatic about Romania. Um when I was on the doctor, a big trigger for me becoming quite kind of like, a bit of a mixed episode I'd call, it was, you know, I was proud research geek, and wanted to do research as part of my career, and we had a research project and every project and I failed it. Um It was really starting to the system, so I was like, oh God, I thought I was good at this and, you know, you end up doubting yourself and no one thought I'm not good enough, and that was kind of a bit of a, a bit of a trigger there, I ended up going to the GP um there was probably times I should have got help. Seem to be honest, no time tomorrow is really so unwell. I don't think I should have been working, but I should have reached out for help before, But I kind of, I kind of floated under secondary mental health services, you know, because I was under them when I was 18, but then at university it was in another country, so it was all done through the university and then you know when I was an assistant a research system. My Gp was also a psychiatrist. So he just kind of took care of me. So I kind of floated very much below if that makes sense. But I probably should have more help earlier but I was just really worried about what would happen what would happen if I love you know you especially when you're on the doctor because it's okay very intense you know you get someone who literally parcel fail replacement. You're being constantly evaluated. So I was really I honestly was catastrophizing fears. Catastrophizing. Now at the time I didn't know what was going to happen. Am I gonna take the same fits practice automatically. So I even go into my G. P. I was really anxious about not being told. Um And it really stopped me getting help when you know when I should have. Um So I think about halfway through the doctor I ended up telling my tutor and the head of the doctor and they were really nice really supportive and not actually very surprised to be quite honest\":(\" really.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \" Yeah they kind of said they said oh you you have a lot of ideas and you always taken on a lot and publishing stuff and this makes sense now it's kinda makes sense. Um But the way they put it which is always really nice to bear in mind was you know you know what sets you off and you know kind of what happens and becoming well so actually from where we're sitting that's really helpful you know? Um So that was really good, it was like a big kind of release and I told her I told a handful of people I was close to in my training cohort. Um uh So that was nice but I would say about that. I had never told anyone in placement until my very last one. Um and this is my last placement so I was kind of like 27 then um I never had depression, I just had kind of hyper manic manic episodes. Um And I have this kind of I think quite hyper manic again career hyper manic writing speed of my dissertation where I just wrote um you know I really was just productive and just wrote a lot and in retrospect maybe I was a little bit manic and then I handed it in and I just crashed and I was in supervision and I just kind of ended up crying and I told my supervisor then what happened is that you know the context but I didn't know I was depressed. I don't know I didn't I didn't realize it even though like final year special interest in my final year trainee, I didn't realize I was depressed until I was really quite deep in it, you know I didn't quite grasp what was going on. Um So I ended up saying to my supervisor, not in the best way, maybe it wasn't a planned thing, but you know, she needed to know um in retrospect, maybe I should have taken a few weeks off, but at the time it was again, what's going to happen? I'm not gonna qualifying time catastrophizing, catastrophizing. Um So yeah, that was that was really that was a difficult placement. Um but I kind of my I ended up coming out the other side and the university organized me some kind of remote therapy with one of the other insights on another course in the country, which was very useful just to kind of understand a little bit more about why have been set off on my warning signs, which is really helpful and\":(\" we spoke about before and when we were talking about some of the feelings that kind of raised in you to be a trainee clinical psychologist at that time, experiencing a mental health difficulty and are I found a real resonance with my experience as well and other peoples that I've heard around ideas of shame in there, the real anxiety,\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \" thinking about, okay, you can special interests. Remember telling a colleague before, and she was like uh huh. Yeah, I did wonder about your special interest. You always wonder when someone has a special interest. So, yeah, you know, again, I remember this same colleague before I told her because I was qualified, she said to me, so it was just something like you, how do you get all these ideas and have this much energy and I'm just gonna make a joke. And I remember someone going tom like, what are you on? And I was just like, you know, just like into the coffee, that's all I need, that kind of thing jokingly obviously. And then when I was more open to tell them that the context, but there's a reason we go into it and sometimes it's our own experiences. Sometimes it's, you know, loved ones who have had these problems you're saying. I think I really like being interested in bipolar disorder and having that experience. And um of course it's not essential. I just think it gives me a different perspective, you know, kind of like say to people, you know, I'm interested in my post order as a researcher and as a clinician and as a service user triples that. Um and of course it's not essential, but it does give me a different perspective because sometimes the research ideas I have start with something I've noticed in my own kind of experience, and then I look at the literature and I go maybe that's so a lot I've done is around bipolar disorder and financial difficulties and impulse spending, and that's very much came from my own um it kind of evolved out of my dissertation which was about student tuition fees and mental health, but then I was thinking about when I was manic, I impulsively spent um to buy furniture for this recording studio is going to have and all of this stuff, and random, massive djembe african drums and all this stuff, and I was like, there's not much written about this, even though people say when you manage you spend spend spend, no one's thinking about why this is so that's definitely fueled my interest there. And I think most of the time it's helpful. There are times when it it's really hard though, I'm like, when I was on my final placement and I was in an inpatient ward and, you know, when people are really pretty hopeless and suicidal and you're feeling really hopeless, it's quite hard, you know, it is, it's harder to kind of resilience goes down and, you know, there's times when someone goes out and everything's just really crap and if you're really down, it's kind of, it is, you know, you kind of thinking in your mind, you almost say that to yourself um\":(\"what helped? Um\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \" and I didn't I didn't say anything. I thought maybe she doesn't know me in that way. But in the end I just thought, no, I'm not being honest here. I told occupational health and everyone, you know, but I told him he basically just like, I think most people are going to what you're doing have their own reasons for it and I'm glad you could be here. So that was really nice and I do sometimes tell service users, but I always do it very think very carefully about it. Um I do it, you've got to make sure that it's it's for them, not for you, you know. Um but there have been some patients when people it's really hard to connect with someone or they're kind of just really hope that you don't get it. And there have been times when I have said, you know I do and I do really think about it carefully and I always take it to supervision and that's really helped. There have been other times when patience was running out. I like to think I don't because I was actually unwell at the time and they were worried about me but I was running a bipolar group and when people said tom All of our thinking is this is like 10 people in the room. So kind of all over the place and wacky center. You just get it, you're not bipolar are you? And everyone laughed and I just kind of awkwardly laughed so I didn't want to lie but I didn't think that was the best time to say yes. Um And then when I saw her 1-1 a few weeks later I did say yeah that was\":(\"the case, yes, that's\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \" yeah, kind of because you wanted to be like, look at me, I thought I'm not gonna go out and I'm not going to do this talk, thinking I'm going to say it, but if it comes up, I'm gonna say it, you know, so I was kind of giving myself the option. Um So I went through, I talked about this formulation initial manic episode and the stuff I've talked to you about losing place at university and this stuff. Um And then at the end, any questions. And one of my colleagues just went, that guy you were talking about, how are you doing now? I was like, well that's an interesting point. So I told them all, and it was really liberating, and then I put a big thing on facebook where I was friends with lots of people from work just saying about it, and it was a really nice reaction because, you know, I told a couple of people before, you know, who had kind of maybe something out and that felt quite nice, but it was like a I share a little secret, you know, it shouldn't be like that, but when I did just completing so come out with people really nice because they were just like, oh my God, I wouldn't have guessed. Um and that makes sense while you're interested in this stuff where you're interested in why this is a special interest and then a lot of people think about their own struggles as well, you know,\":(\"Which they\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \" didn't feel like they could talk about now that I'm in a place where I am open about it and everyone knows people have said to me, are you okay tom I have noticed, you know, seems like your mind's racing a bit and a little bit on the go today, are you okay? Much better for keeping myself? Well, because the problem is when you keep it all locked up and all that kind of shame, like it's a dirty secret, you won't tell anyone until you really have to to the whole idea of prevention, early intervention becomes so much harder, you know? Um So it's it's nice that I can be open about it. Um and that my managers ask how are you doing and I can share my relapse prevention plan. Um So that that was really important kind of place to be and I think it was around that time I kind of started to notice myself coming up. Well it wasn't related to that, I remember remember timescales anyway around kind of a few years ago as well, I started to become unwell and I ended up going into secondary care for the first time since I was 18. Um so that was interesting as well because you know, it was I was a patient in the place where I've been on placement in a few years before and I knew some of the psychiatrists a little bit professionally from when I was on placement um and they noted that they're like, I know I know you're in another context, it's just okay. Yes it is. Um and they were really nice and I feel\":(\"like,\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",

Um But it did make me laugh as well, the psychiatrist said because I had kind of little bits of therapy, but not kind of fell on, the psychiatrist said, okay, so let me get this right, you know, so we've got medication. What about psychological therapy? And I said, yeah, I really I really appreciate that, I really find that helpful. Okay, so I'm gonna go to my clinical psychology colleagues and ask for someone to do for bipolar disorder with an expert in for bipolar disorder and they're going to love me.\":(\"Oh my goodness. So\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \" yeah, it was it was a bit, it was a bit difficult because I it was like we had to go to a list of, do you know this person? Do you know this person? Yes. Yes, Yes. Um So I I ended up being assessed by someone who had kind of known a little bit from meetings and that was fine. Actually, I didn't mind after the first couple of times and then they ended up they ended up my the conscious saw um he's amazing. So I teach for the CBT bipolar story part of the CBT diploma. Um So I do the teaching for that. Um and I use my own experiences, I kind of do smash it with my own experiences. And the feedback I get is that's really helpful, which is really nice. But the first time I did that she was doing the diploma and then two years later she was my therapist. So basically like she learned how to do seem to for bipolar disorder from me and then we're trying to get him to do So\":(\"again,\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \" got it and we work together. But coming from a different angle suggesting things in therapy that I wouldn't have thought of really useful, but it was kind of like starting formulation was like, why don't you go in and work in this formulation? Because I know you're really getting into it, okay, so I go and work and do lots of diagrams and arrows and then bring it back and okay, this is good, you know, so yeah, it worked well, but it was that was the first time I'd gone into kind of a proper period of therapy rather than kind of I've done bits and bobs like online therapy and a few sessions here. Few sessions are um really have life changed that whole the whole kind of motor of high standards, just slow down and all of this. I remember saying to when I was initially assessed now, I say all this part of me that, you know, more and more and more. Again, it's related to my career. I get manic about publishing stuff in my career and grants and all this stuff, you know, And I've become nearly unwell when I had good news about a research grant and it makes my head explode. So, it's kind of a very interesting relationship, but it really kind of wound that down and focusing on what really matters to me, my values rather than the highest achievement. Remember got really brought home to me when I said it was part of me that would just keep going more and more and more and it would never be enough. And she said, you know, it's not dissimilar to an anorexia way. It's like I'm going for this, wait. And then when you get to it, I'm going to go a bit lower, go a bit lower and, you know, it's that same kind of searching for a goal and you just move the goalposts. So it's just been so helpful too, really reevaluate my relationship with my career and not place as much emphasis on ticking boxes and reaching goals. But I don't think it's made me, made me anymore Unproductive. Remember saying, what's your fear about therapy and any worries. I'm worried that I'm going to get so relaxed, I'm just gonna not be bothered about my work anymore. You\":(\" know,\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \" I believe myself, critical high standards. You sure when it's not? Um so now there are tons when I do find myself saying I'm not good enough and I've got to work harder and it's still something I live with. But that drive to kind of overachieve, which was a double edged sword in terms of my creative like, boom and bust, definitely. It's just wound down. I remember saying to her at the end, it's like I've I've been training my life to get an olympic gold in my career and I just realized I just like running doesn't really matter.

Um It just leads you to compare yourself to others and think I'm not good enough. I'm never going to get on and then the doctor is intense and you're constantly under a microscope. So yeah, I think there's a lot of people, I think, you know, we do have a lot of self critical thoughts and high standards in our profession and some people that, you know, clinical to the extent that it's a mental health problem.

Getting away from the house is clearly one of the things um doing something where we can take the dog is another thing like I enjoy like getting out and taking the dog with us. He has fun, we have fun. It's doing things outside usually not shopping not that kind of stuff Like I don't I'm not a big shopper. Um But I do like to get out in nature and I like to whether it is like it's starting to get cold now so this probably isn't the right time for this but like you know um going out and going fly fishing or um going for hikes or as the weather starts to get colder, maybe really contemplating where we're gonna go snowshoeing. So we actually have a like we're thinking about that kind of stuff and it doesn't even have to be like overnight stuff. It could be, we live in a place that's super close to lots of outdoor activities. It's just that we actually have to get outdoors to do them.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",

So if we don't do them, then his list is just building, right? Um So I think that's my story about his story.

Or like we spent yesterday, like I vacuumed the whole entire garage that there's not a spiderweb. Well there may be one left, but you know what I mean? Like we cleaned out like the garage feels great to walk in right now. Um and we only have another six months of, you know, weekends that are probably required in order to get because we had both of our moms living with us. And then, um, so we have not just our stuff in our garage, but we also have two mothers stuff in the garage and his mom passed away. My mom's moved back to New Mexico, but there's some stuff that's just not going to be going anywhere. So I have to figure out what to do with it. And so, And lots of it needs to be shredded because it's things like taxes from 1997, you know what I mean? So, and and that stuff doesn't just happen by itself. Like you've got to actually go out there and shred it or hire somebody to come and shred it. Mm.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \" Wow. Yeah, I totally, I totally understand and I totally get the whole idea of when you're spending so long with being responsible and caring and serving other people. Um when that shifts, it can be hard to shift your time spent as well, right? Yeah,\":(\" It's not quite like emptiness syndrome, but there elements of similarity. The difference is we didn't have to do it for 18 years, you know, and really great friends. So it isn't like we had disconnected along the way, right? Like we stayed connected. Um and yeah, well we've gotten disconnected from as a couple is the just the fun of just going out and having an adventure together on a regular basis and, and I think the reason it's coming up so strongly for me right now is that we finally, I really do have, my mom's been gone. We've had time, we're starting to do it. But then again, there's these agreements that we made that we're not taking action on like scuba diving. Um and I think it is for me committing because we're starting to have the conversations, but really committing to this idea of what will bring us reel every weekend. What will bring us joy and not throwing out, like, maybe what we really need to do, and this maybe is the conversation I need to be having with Michael is one day of each weekend is set aside for us. one day is set aside for chores, right? So, because those things have to be done, laundry has got to be done, houses gotta be clean, things like that. Um and one day is set aside to get in the car and go somewhere and do something for the Mhm. And we didn't do this this weekend. We spent saturday going into the olympic National Forest and we went, you know, hiking a little bit in the, like a hurricane ridge. And then we went down to the Elbe River where the baby salmon are spawning, well where the salmon has been spawning, there's all these little salmon that are, it was very cool, like along this river. So, um so we did it this weekend, so that's great. Um\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",

How did that happen this weekend?\":(\" I was like, we are leaving this house, where do you want to go? Like, where do you want to go? Because we're going? And I was throwing out some different ideas and he's like, that's too far, this is too far, let's do this. And so it's like, fine, let's do that. So that's what we did. Um and so I think it was, it was just determination.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \"Okay, so determination is a success factor. Um What was the effect of having that time away?\":(\" We had such a good time, you know, and you see things um you're looking at the, you're seeing new things with your eyes, aren't looking at the same things that you always look at, right? Um and so there was that novelty piece of, I've never been to any of these places that we went um they're so huge, we could go back to them over and over again and I would see something different every single time, right? So there's that um and and then coming home, we, you know, stopped at this really cool place and had this like awesome meal and a couple of local brews, you know what I mean? And it was just like this nice rounded out fun day which then led to sunday when we were cleaning in the garage. Um We had so much done, you know what I mean? So\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",

So you wanted to get to some action items and I've heard you talk about the conversation you want to have?\":(\" Yeah, those are really the action items. I think it's really the two conversations that, well the one conversation with the two parts um that I want to have with Michael about, you know, and we started this conversation because we were having it a bit on saturday about how nice it was to just be outside and you know, and exploring some areas we hadn't been before. Um He hadn't been to hurricane ridge since he was like seven. So yeah and and so that was a while ago um Without giving ages away or anything like that. Um Let's just say it was a while a long while ago. Um So we were starting that conversation but I think that other element of how we both sharpen our saws may be different and really having some clarity around. How do we honor that for both of ourselves? I think that's important and I think the I think the accountability piece, because I know I had mentioned something around accountability is comes out of that conversation right? So that he and I are like holding each other accountable and it isn't just me going let's go, let's go, let's go. But it's him going all right, this is the weekend, we these are the two weekends we agree this is one of our go away weekends, you know? And that way I don't feel like it's just me pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, get me the hell out of here, right? You know? But\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \" right? Right. And what I'm hearing is that there's I'm actually hearing three things. There's you as an individual, your husband is an individual and you as a couple. Um for shopping for sharpening your saw. So there are three pizzas. Two.\":(\" Yeah that's a good insight I'm gonna write that down real quick. Yeah um attempted to write it in a text message so that I can just text it to him. Three areas for sharpening. Um Me, you us. Yeah and here's the deal to like I don't see him enough that I want like I mean that I really want to do something separate from him on the weekend. Like I find myself turning down things. Um That's on weekends because I don't get to see him enough as it is that I don't want to. Mhm. Have like oh I'm going out with girlfriends to go do X. Y. Z. I try and do that stuff during the week.

Um I think the other being that is the takeaway is just I mean, really just how much this is important to me and I believe it's also important to Michael. So, I don't feel like I'm alone in this um and this shifting and roles like, like this making the next step in the shift towards not being caretakers for our moms. You know, that we're really there, we have this opportunity. And I'll be honest with you, I didn't bring this up in the conversation, but this is something that's a takeaway because it's popping into my mind right now.

So I'm leaving the board. I'm leaving the board and I am interested in continuing to volunteer with the board. And yet there's been some sense of maybe I should not volunteer with the board because I've been in a leadership position with the board, but to give space for new leaders to emerge. And, and I'm trying to sort of assess how I feel about that. Like, the conversation, I had a conversation this morning with president and I'm past president of this particular board and I'm looking at just wanting to help kind of behind the scenes with the website. It's not like I want to have a leadership position. Um, but the sense was that, You know, maybe I need to because I've been so president on the board since 2000 And really started playing with the board in 2005, and then really in leadership since 2006, 2005, 2015. and 2016, I've been in leadership that people just default to going to me. Yeah. And um, and so maybe stepping off and not having anything to do with the board would allow other people to move forward on in leadership. And so there's a part of me that I and I had the conversation where I said, you know, I'm really feeling like I'm being pushed out When I'd still like to volunteer. I mean, and I've had a volunteer job since I was 12 and II love the board that I'm on. So there's a piece of me that is like\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",

I\":(\" honestly think that a useful outcome for me would be to have a sense of how I want to move forward. And if I'm not going to stay with the board or help, like if I'm not, if I'm gonna, if I'm gonna choose to step away entirely and that isn't necessarily the only option. But if I were to choose to do that, What else would I mean? I've had a volunteer job since I was 12. Ah, what do I do? Right. What do I, what do I, what do I want to put my energy into that's volunteer if I'm not doing it with this organization. So\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",

I kind of go in and I try on different ideas like coats and I kind of look in a mirror in my head of does this code even fit? Does it look good? Like is this really the coat I want or, and then I take it off and I put on a different code and I kind of go through the same thing and I kind of try different things on sort of in a mental mirror. Um before I then test the waters more deeply than that. And honestly, as you say that the thing that's really coming to into my mind is that because because I had really considered staying on with this board as a volunteer, not on the board itself, but is it just a volunteer within the organization. I hadn't really thought about any other coats. I might try on, right,\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",

So many of those coats, what would that look like for you now?\":(\" So the thing that that I'm thinking is I actually really have not done as much with animals in a long time is I did when I was younger and when I was younger I volunteered what was then the Steinhart aquarium and it was great. I loved it. I mean it was so much fun and I like, I love animals and and I'm just even curious like with the like there's wildlife rescue in the area that I live, there's um I think that I think that if I were to be thinking about a section of the wardrobe, it would be a section having to do with animals because I've worked so extensively with people Since I've been in it like since about 18 because I started working with rape crisis and I was a hospital advocate and I was going into the hospital and then just really unreasonable for me here where I live because it takes me 45 minutes to get to a hospital to up to two hours. So That's just not gonna happen. And I and honestly, I don't really want to do crisis intervention since I spent the last 20 years being a therapist doing a lot of crisis intervention, it just feels like more like work. Um So I really think if I were to look at a section of my wardrobe, it would be a section around animals.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",

It's the expansion of it's, it's the expansion of awareness that these are living creatures who are having a life experience and in any way we can make it less shitty. Um that would be a kindness and I think that the world is in dire need of more compassion and kindness and so that for me is really the linkage. Yeah, I think that's really, I think that's a big piece of that for me and I know I know I can feel it's true because I can just feel it sitting here in my chest and in my throat that this is really important to me.

I think it comes down to um, looking at some of the organizations that are here locally on where I live in Washington, um, state where I want to clarify that in Washington state, um, where I live. Um, and And looking at what is just immediately within, you know, a 10-15 mile radius of where I live to start seeing. I know we have like a wildlife rescue. I know there's other rescue organizations in the area that I could drive to. Um, if I were to go and do like into an office and be of service in that way or working with the animals themselves. Um, and then expanding out from there. If I don't find something that really resonates for me to some of the larger organizations that, you know, best friends or some of those other larger rescue organizations.

You're not quite often, but what might you bring from that experience as a skill set that might support this new volunteerism category?\":(\" Well, one of the things that's been most beneficial about the last experience that I've had is I have learned how to wear pretty much every hat in the organization from president to rolling out an entire virtual learning platform to finding speakers to do like virtual learning. But I mean I also do podcasting. So I mean there's like all this other stuff that I can do. Um, and like helping, like helping some organ, like there's all these different things that I've learned how to do in the last, You know, 20 years of my life of creating businesses and business management and working with boards and organizations. Plus there's coaching in and of itself within an organization that's a volunteer organization, uh, to, to the fundamentals of like just being in the back and helping maintain a web page or a website, right? Like I'm not attached to it being in the front of the room. I'm more attached to being a service.

She was actually one of the 1st 25 people to earn the Master certified coach designation and was the fifth global president of the I. C. F. And currently sits on the board. She was recognized in 2018 by global gurus as the number five coach in the world. So congratulations on that Marcia and a fun fact from Marcia today she is wearing the shirt that she wore when she did her ted X, how to handle Precocious women at the Perryville Women's correctional prison and then we have Christine mullen joining us from Auckland. So welcome and thank you for joining us. her background is in change management and H. R. And she's currently evolving and refining what she enjoys and studying career development. She has been coached before but never by Marcia. So this is her first session ever with Marcia and a fun fact from her today. She is a farm girl at heart, living in the city with her kitty and her man and is going to be visiting the family farm in a month to go play with some baby cows and get her country fixed on and with that I am going to turn it over to Marsha. Welcome.\":(\" Great thank you. Okay, let me share my screen. Okay um so um today I want to define just a few things about what maybe makes my coaching a little bit different and what to listen for. So I do come from uh and I C. F. Perspective uh and to me that means that I really focus on coaching the person in front of me, I'm coaching this person who has an issue and what is stopping this creative, resourceful and whole person from being able to solve this on their own. I really want to um dispel some of the stereotypes around um I cf coaching that there is a specific way and yes, you know there's there's training on skills and competencies in order to get your a C. C. Or PCC certification and we embed those. Um but to me the coaching is around around being really present and it's not that it's a very strict way. So you're gonna hear me doing things if you're an I. C. F. Coach you might go, oh wow, look at her. She uses a lot of closed questions. I do. And and it's because to me really nailing what it is drilling into, what is it this person really wants requires some clarification. And sometimes asking, is it this or is it this or you know, it sounds like that's most important to you. Um That may be the things that I use. So the I. C. F. Coaching model is really based on a process called reflective inquiry. And I say reflective because it's not just asking questions. The reflective part is really critical that we're holding up the mirror for the person to really listen to themselves and hear themselves. Because within that process they start to see, oh wow, Huh. Did I say that? Is that what I'm doing? And they start thinking for themselves in a way that they couldn't do on their own and to be able to do this, we have to create a very safe space. So uh in I. C. F. There's a lot around creating trust and intimacy. Um making sure that the person feels very comfortable because you may be touching on some things that create some vulnerability. So when we look at, when I'm talking about that. There are times when you're coaching that you don't even go through all the steps, sometimes the person just needs a sounding board. Um I had a client that she paid me a lot of money to come in and just listen and ask a few questions and and maybe um make a few reflections and she'd always have this incredible awareness. Um and oftentimes, one of the reasons I've chosen not to coach coaches is oftentimes coaches will coach themselves in the process, uh or they want to help the coach and and I want to make sure that that that doesn't happen. Um it doesn't always happen, but I just thought it was really important. So when I put out, I said, I really am looking for someone who's a non coach and we'll see how that goes. Um the most important thing is that when you have a client who really is circling, resisting jumping down side roads, and I'm sure most of you have had that situation, then I really believe that this process of of really getting them to look at what they're saying, who they are in this moment, what's really triggering them um is really critical and of course, you need an end destination. We have to know where we're going in order to keep things on track. But in those moments, then I really believe that what we're looking at is what's truly blocking this person um from knowing what to do, seeing what to do next, understanding the situation, uh in a way that if that we can create together again? That's very difficult and I can, in previous w back sessions, I talked about why we don't do self reflection well, and so you're you're doing them a great service by helping them think by being there thinking partner. So in this process, the reflective inquiry process when I talk about direct communication and that's my favorite competency is being just giving back to the person I received and I give back and direct communication is not challenging them, critiquing advising. And and and I say this because I teach um I'm in china twice a year, I've talked extensively around Asia and I always get that we're not direct, Our culture is not direct and I'm not talking about again being in someone's face, I'm talking about just being very clear and concise and sharing what I see what I hear um what I'm sensing, so reflecting is um what am I noticing? You're gonna hear me summarize a lot. So you're telling me this or I can tell that this is the thing that's really bothering you, is that true? So, seeing, hearing noticing? And and I also, in previous sessions, many of you, if you know me have heard me talk about using your entire nervous system. So opening not just your your mind with curiosity, but opening your heart and your gut. Um uh So you can really pull in from all your major processing centers, what is it the person is giving you and be able to reflect that back to them. So you, so what I'd like you to listen for is those times when I say, when I summarize, when I say, I notice this or I heard you say, you know, I'm sensing this is what's going on. And I know that when you say, you know, I'm sensing this is this true, that it's sometimes difficult to not interpret that you put your own opinion and you interpret what they're saying and that's not to say that I don't make that mistake as well. Um, but I'm truly trying to, you know, sometimes I'll choose a different word than the person says just to summarize it concisely. Um, but usually I use the words that they give me, um, and try not to add anything into it. And the more I can stay out of my head, the better I am at that I always say that thinking is the enemy of the coach. And so presence to me is really the key. So, um, what, what I'd like you to listen for is how you hear me reflecting what I see in here. I'm also gonna be looking for any patterns, um, any uh emotionally charged statements and, and the key I often find in coaching is the shift in emotion that I'll \n",
            "                                            be coaching someone and it's like, you know, just going along the way and all of a sudden there'll be a shift, they'll go from excited to quiet um or they'll be talking about something and they get really passionate about something and I'm going to reflect back that shift because something triggered that shift and that's usually the key um to to what it is we're looking at. So I really listen for that. Um again, I try to use their words as much as possible, so I'd like you to listen for that and and and again, please understand that you may hear something else and you may go a different way and and that's what's so beautiful about coaching is that there's many paths to take. So Christine has been coached by a couple of coaches and I'm sure she's gonna find, I'm entirely different, you know? So there's not one right way to coaching and that's also what's wonderful is that, you know, you might have a coach for a while and then decide you want someone new because they come at it a different way. So that's what we're going to look at today, so we'll just get to it. So let me stop my share. I'm gonna move it to there. Okay, and I'm gonna go to a full screen. Yes, I can see you, so Christine, thank you and it's again, for the audience um Christine was kind of like the sub and then everybody else backed out and so she just knew a couple of days ago I said you're up, so thank you so much for being available. Yeah, yeah, so um and and again, full disclosure. So we briefly talked and the reason why is because I've not coached her, I just want to make sure that whatever she had was a coaching topic and not looking for advice or mentoring and she did and that's about all that we got into. So I'm somewhat familiar with what she's going to bring, but Christine what I'd like you to do is just um you know, tell me a little bit about, you know, this this thing that you're you're you're dealing with that you want to talk about today. Yeah, thank you. Um So I am off work at the moment. I've just started being a student, but part of the trigger behind where I came to being a student was I had a actually it was a year long headache that was diagnosed as a neck injury. And so I've been getting physio on my neck for the last four months. Um and so I'm about to sort of, you know, go back into wanting to look for work. Um And one thing that is on my mind is my self care because I do have habits of um having a self care plan and it all goes um it's all looking really good and then things happen and things go wayward and then all of a sudden I crash um and I've also got a history of a chronic illness in my early thirties. So for me, self care plan is quite important because I have had a few periods in my life where illness or injuries have sort of come about. So yeah, so that's something that I know I need in my in my life, okay, And but it sounds like it's something that you've been dealing with for a very long time trying to get on this regime of self care. Is that true? It is, I mean it's, I mean it's a continual thing, so I'm always sort of looking at new ways to sort of monitor and and so forth. But like one thing for me is, I know like I just did this last week, I and my partner goes nuts at me because he goes, you just do change too fast, you know, here I am rehabbing myself and I go to the gym and I and increase my weight last week and you know, feeling really was feeling really good, just mess things up and so I kind of do this, introduce things a little bit too fast and these repercussions and I do know that when you do like returning to work or so forth, you don't need to sort of introducing things, but I get a little bit kind of frustrated with the down that comes after it, I guess, so I do these things and then can I kick myself and go, why did I do that? And I did it again and then my partner's guy, you did it again chris so okay, so you have a sense of what gets in your way. So um, if if you were then to have a situation where you felt you were consistent with your self care, what would that look like? Okay, it would be that the up and downs wouldn't be so dramatic. So I like kind of like, and I think that I think the fear is of going back to work is is that I'm introducing a whole new element and a whole new, you know, at the moment I'm kind of excluded from people unless I bring them in, but for me going back into the work environment particularly, I've just sit in good posture and so some of my fears there is I lose my posture, which I did last week as well from studying and just things like I got caught up in my study and was tilting my head and so forth and then all of a sudden bang and so it's those sort of behaviors that I kind of can't see the triggers coming and then all of a sudden it's the snowballs. So, um, but that's an interesting thing. So you, you just mentioned about uh posture and, and that's really important to you because of your injury. So, um, is that the biggest thing that that goes, that you're afraid of as you go back to work? No, it's probably more the whole setting in terms of, you know, like being in the good posture, but also introducing um\",\"option\"),\n",
            "                                          \" um and the idea was we would love to see live coaching demonstrations, We want to see people actually do this so that we can be better and so we made it happen and you guys have loved them so much that we decided to bring them forward into the full summit so that they're available to our full summit pass holders and I do want to just quickly launch a poll for you, um you should see it on your screen now, if you could please just take a minute to fill it out, it's a super quick poll and I'm gonna leave it up for the duration of the session. In fact, I'll leave it up three minutes beyond the session so that everybody has the opportunity to share their feedback with us. Mhm And now I'm gonna go ahead and ask kristen if you can just pop the link again one more time into the chat box. So folks have it, if they haven't opened the chat box yet for the passes as well as the facebook link, if they want to join the conversation and share their golden nugget from tonight's session. And so now I'm gonna go ahead and take some questions. So again we had lots and lots of of expressions of thanks to both you Marsha and to you Christine for allowing us to be flies on the wall and and listen to this amazing session. So let's see. We had a couple of themes so I'll touch on the themes. Um A couple of folks were saying are wanting to kind of clarify difference between coaching and asking for advice, coaching and advising coaching and mentoring, coaching and therapy. Can you just kind of touch on that Marcia?\":(\" Yeah, I do want to say one of the things because I know I said it this morning and didn't today that there is a difference between giving information and giving advice. So a couple of times to Christine, I did share uh just briefly um some information and and that's okay, that's not telling her what to do with it. Um But you know, mentoring is when I'm sharing with you my ideas, my giving advice, telling you what to do. I didn't tell her what to do with her worry. I could have but she had this, you know, again I want to come back to the I. C. F. Definition of coaching is that you are a partner. I'm her partner not not her advice giver or her therapist, I'm partnering with her and she's a creative, resourceful and whole person, she's not broken, she's not broken, I don't need to fix her, even when she got emotional, I do not need to fix her. You know, I'm often, um I see that so often with coaches and so they want to jump in and go, don't feel that way. I don't need to take care of her. She's fully capable. She's a smart, creative, confident, um resourceful, whole person and I know that she's going to bring this forth on her own. Um, and so that's the difference. Um, and and therapy, you know, I I did ask how long this has been going on, but you noticed I didn't go into, I never even asked her what, you know what it was, her illness and how that impacted her. I I don't really need to go too much into her history. Um If I felt that her level of fear or worry was um debilitating that, that she could not get over it. Um then I would suggest talking to a therapist or a counselor that would not be a coaching issue, but but it wasn't because she said she has ways and I asked her, I said, is there things in the past that you've done and she said yes, and and and that's what led me to even like, okay, so is this, you know, and fears tends to be based in Reality-other worried is not. So when I said, is this fear of worry, whether she knew that she knew right away, if you notice she said, oh no, it's a worry. So it's something in her new that distinction. So, um although fear can be made up as well, so uh I never felt the need to to shift into any kind of what would be therapeutic therapy. I mean, there's many therapies that are similar to coaching, like cognitive behavioral therapy looks at limiting beliefs and things like that. So, so you could say, wow, you were doing some of that. Well, reflective inquiry is very similar to some modes of therapy, but again, I did not go back into her past patterns, or when did she actually start questioning her abilities in her life? I never asked her that question. So that would be the the line and honestly, those of you, I don't know if it's just available to members or not, but if you're nicely f member, they just came out with a wonderful piece on the distinction between therapy and coaching and I believe it's in the ethics portion on the website. Um So, you know, I would look for that because I know that they sent it out to all the members. So it was a really well done peace. So I hope that answers it. Mhm.\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \" Thank you for that. And so Sharon has a question for Christine, she's saying what was the turning point in the session for you and you know, what was the most powerful moment?\":(\" I think it was probably when I started tearing up because that's probably when it really become real like, oh this is really meaning something. It was I think probably going back to that worry and I didn't think this was about worrying when I started, I didn't think I'd have a few tears, but I know I said to the person, so probably wasn't surprised, you know, I just want to say that also. Um often in the reflective process when people really then all of a sudden see themselves in a way they've not been looking at themselves before they will have an emotional reaction. So whether you you're a sensitive person or not, you know, I talked about that, you know, in the research I did for the discomforts on my book that that realization will trigger an emotional response. And it could be anything from tears to anger. I've had clients hang up on me scream at me and hang up on me. You know, unfortunately they call me back two. But part of coaching then is to be able to just hold the space, you know, for whatever reaction they have emotions are just energy moving through the body and it's not bad. It's it's you judge yourself for your not bad. They're not bad and they're just a thing that we as human beings experience. You know, we always want our robots to be yeah, more human with emotions, but we want our the robots, you know, so it's it's a part of living. Um so I'm just sharing this with the coaches. Is that that's okay if there's a reaction that means there was an awareness and there's growth. Um so I always say, you know the coaches it's okay if you make your client uncomfortable because that's the process of of of of awareness and growing um that that will help them to move forward with whatever it is they're facing. So yeah, thank\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          \" Let's see. So we're getting a lot again, lots of thank you's and um, let's see. Someone asked earlier about the homework. I know you talked briefly about homework for Christine. Um, I think it was Janet that was asking that question, what was the homework that you were telling? Christine to do?\":(\" You know? She just said, um, when I asked her what were some other things that would around that would help her to recall her her strength, right Christine. It was to be able to recall her strength. And she, she says, I don't know. I have to think about it. And so I just want to make sure that she's going to go think about it. So that's why I said, wow, it sounds like that's some homework or some, you know, something you need to do. It's not like I want you to turn it into me by 2:00 tomorrow I guess I guess because I've been coached before, I kind of knew that you kind of have some action steps at the end. So the use of the word homework wasn't endorsing to me. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. And I actually like homework personally give me some action. You giving women the precocious woman, you\",\"Reality-other\"),\n",
            "                                          ' got the right shirt on. Okay, So guy is asking um when a client is determined for you to provide them with ideas or give advice, how do you handle that? How do you how do you back out of that?':(\" You know, it's an interesting thing. Again, I I I often say, you know, I really believe in you and I think you do have some ideas and I'd like to hear yours first. Um you know, and it is interesting because oftentimes I have coach like brand new managers and there are sometimes where I realize that this isn't about coaching, this is about mentoring. This person has no idea, has no experience and has no idea and you can't coach to nothing, you know? But but I I let the person know, it's like, okay, it sounds like it's not about coaching you in this moment that that there's, you know, that you would like some ideas to choose from. I rarely um do that, but sometimes, like I said sometimes if they have nothing to drawn then then it's crazy uh to keep coaching. So, you know, the thing is is it a knowledge, um um or skills lack, then it's not coaching if it's a motivation or confidence, then it's coaching, Like one of the women that actually volunteered for this um and I said, so what would you like coaching on? And she said I really want to know how to take my book and find a publisher and how to create more visibility, that's not a coaching topic, and I said, you know what, I'd love to help you, but it sounds like you want the benefit of my experience. Um And so I actually gave her a half hour since she raised her hand and I said I'll give you a half hour of mentor, you know, advice giving, but but that's not, you know, I'm not gonna coach you on that, so that will come up, I mean she had no idea what to do and so that that's a whole different thing, but I hesitate when people say, oh I don't know what to do, I really ask, is that they don't know where they're afraid of admitting what to do, you know, where it's like, oh I can't make a decision, I need you to help me. Well frankly, most people have already made the decision, they're just afraid to accept the decision that they've made. Um you know, and so it's like I'm looking for, which is the one they have more energy, what's the decision they have more energy around, so don't get sucked into that, I don't know what to do, Help me, Their creative, resourceful and whole\",\"goal\"),\n",
            "                                          \" wonderful. Um So mary's asking I'm wondering how, you know when to acknowledge a client's emotions and when to let them pass because I know we saw that Christine got emotional earlier and you you mentioned it was not my job to make that right?\":(\" And it's okay\",\"option\"),\n",
            "                                          ' for people to be uncomfortable. So where do you go with that? And when do you acknowledge? And when do you let it go okay':(\" with crying? I usually give them some space, okay. And I won't I never say, oh do you need some time and you know, all that, I just, you know, give them just a little bit of space or like I just I let her breathe a little bit and said, so tell me what's going on. Um So I don't want to delve into it, I don't want to make this a weakness or make her feel bad that she's crying. Um You know, so it's just again, I just kind of allow all criers come out of it if you allow them okay and they always tell you okay, I'm fine or something, so and I'm a crier too, so you know, you give them a little space, they'll come out of it and it'll be fine. Um the discomfort with, you know, I'm drilling down into something here. Um and I'm gonna take you with me and it's not gonna feel so good. Well okay that's fine. I can tell again, because I'm present. If this is like not a place they want to go, then I'll then I'll stop say, okay, I get that, this isn't you don't want to go there, so let's go back to this. And that's why you must be present, you must be present with your client to know where they are. And are they really willing um to go there with you, Is it okay? Even if it's uncomfortable, so stay present and sense where they're at, They're giving you signals and you just need to pick it up and give it back. Don't be afraid of emotions and I'm sharing this because that's a big part of the work. So, I mean, you can find a lot of this just in my blog, you don't have to get the book, but you know, you can find a lot of stuff about how to deal with your own emotions and other people's emotions and I have shared a lot and come to my full summit, I'm going to do another demo and talk about this more deeply thank\",\"goal\"),\n",
            "                                          \" okay. Um and this is a question coincidentally came up from someone else. So julie is saying, I am an internal coach and I'm being asked to coach someone that's in performance management, told this person that it doesn't, coaching doesn't work if you're not open to it, but they're going to meet with them. But she's saying her question is, how do you respectfully end a coaching engagement? What do you do when it's not working?\":(\" Well, there's two things here, like, in the moment, you know, if if the coach, the client is resistant and doesn't really want this, then I would call it right there and say, okay, it clearly that you've been told you need to be coached and this isn't something you really want to do. Is that true? Um, I would call it, and and then, you know, I have had earlier in my career, especially, you know, more remedial type of coaching with people who needed coaching and, you know, and I would say, okay, I know what they want, but we have this time together, I said, you know, it's like, what would be most useful for you to work through that I can help you with since we have this time together. And oftentimes they'll bring up like, well, you know, it's my relationship with them, I don't know how to handle that and that's creating the problem, and, and so there's the other side of it. So, so I see if we can't get to something, but I did have a guy that I kept saying, you know, it's like we come to this and you tell me all the good things you do and all the bad things your boss do and that you're not giving me anything that to work with you um to get better on and and so I don't know where we're going with the coaching um and you know, and and we actually ended that, so there's that if the client isn't showing up to sessions, um if this is a repetitive action, then, you know, I will call them out on that as well and say, so it doesn't seem that the coaching is all that important to you because sometimes, you know, when they're not paying for it themselves, you know, the company is paying for whatever, They don't value it as much and and uh yeah, I understand, I reschedule at times and I know people have meetings but they have to make it important and they have to show a pattern of making it important. Um so we'll end it there, but oftentimes will just disappear. That's the end of that and I'll need to let them to HR no or whatever, it's like, well they haven't come to three sessions were done.

Um, there's always a slight shift um, with the keyword and the keyword is usually an adjective, a descriptive word. Um or it's a picture like roller coaster, okay, which was his metaphor. So it's a descriptive word or a metaphor that they use. That that seemed to be really and a big part of their thinking. Um, and so this is why presence is so critical because if you're thinking about what question I should ask you will miss it. And I see coaches do this all the time. You know, the client will give it to them. They'll have the the shift and the word but the coaches stuck in what questions should I ask and they miss it. I'm like you missed it, you missed the key word. So you've got to trust that however able you are to coach right now is good enough. And and questions should never come from your memory. Questions should always come from your curiosity in the moment. Okay. I don't think about questions at the beginning. Maybe like you know what's on your mind and at the end, you know, when are you gonna do this? What resources do you need? That's the book ends, the book ends are standard.

What is it you want instead I need that the outcome, the outcome is not a problem. The outcome is a desired state. Okay then I can go back to um uh rejection self esteem, whatever I can go back to that, but I'm not asking what problem he wants to work on. I'm asking what outcome he wants to create. This is a huge distinction that coaches need to be, remember, otherwise you're going to chase them with all the problems they present instead of getting very clear on where are we going with this, what is it you want instead? And what he wanted was kind of dual, you know, the sense of uh and the energy to keep the energy up. Um but it was, the key word to me was consistency because I'm like what keeps your energy up? So that wasn't even the outcome. When he said when I'm consistent with this, I was like, oh there it is, there's what I really, really want is somehow to maintain consistency because then those dips won't be so low, my self esteem won't be so so damaged. Okay, so I had to drill down to what it is he really wanted, okay, in order to know where are we going with this and then how do those problems play into that? That outcome is critical and not.

It was a very siloed organization before and that is something from a management style. I hate, I like them to talk to each other and not always to me and then I need to pass on the message. So we were coached on that and there was an evolution and at a certain time I thought, well, you know, this is going well, I can let go a little bit more of the Belgian team, they need less of my attention and that backfired immediately, as soon as I felt that I let go, they were falling back into old habits today we are again two years further down the line and again, I have that same feeling I can let go more because by now they should know how to communicate to each other, which they do, but it's still not entirely where I wanted to be, but at the same time I have my own ambition which I feel is becoming more and more international and european level again. So I am struggling today with when is it okay for me to let go the Belgian team who's asking still asking for that attention?

That sounds like whenever you get into one of your anxiety attacks, you get into a pattern of breathing that I suspect maybe it makes things harder for you. And you told me about that one time when you actually had a fainting spell whenever you started breathing real fast. So it'll be okay to try to see if we could learn some things that would help you manage your breathing whenever you're going to one of these panic attacks. Actually, there's been a fair amount of research done now that shows that if people can learn how to breathe in a certain way that calms them and settles them down, that actually that technique alone can be one of the very top things that you can do to get control of our anxiety. Right? So let's just spend a little time talking about breathing. Now. Do you have a sense of uh you know how often people breathe when they're, how many, how many breasts people take a minute whenever they're calm and resting and not particularly nervous? I\":(\" guess if I'm not nervous, I don't think about my breathing. So we'll just,\",\"Reality-self\"),\n",
            "                              \" Minute, 30. Some people say 50, 60, 70 I've heard as high as that, that sounds fast. Does it actually the correct number is about 15 or 16 rest a minute. Okay, so if you had a watch and you were timing these things would be maybe about one every four seconds. That's both in and out. And when people get into an anxiety attack, how how fast do you think they breathe typically? Pretty quick? Pretty quick?\":(' Like a dog',\"option\"),\n",
            "                              \" panting? Really? Is that the way you do it? Okay? So whenever you're going to a panic attack, you're breathing faster? And what else do you think changes when you're, when you're in a panic\":(\" attack? Well I've noticed I start out kind of shallow and then I feel like I don't get enough air and so then it gets deeper and deeper and doesn't help though. I just feel like I can't get enough air any\",\"Reality-self\"),\n",
            "                              \" And how fast do you think I'm breathing?\":(' I guess if I counted it maybe 12 or 15 times a minute every few seconds',\"Reality-self\"),\n",
            "                              \" And how about my mouth gasping for air, breathing faster, making a lot of noise when I breathe? Alright, so this is the way people breathe when they're feeling calm and I suspect it's how you breathe when you're feeling. In fact, I've seen you and that's pretty much how you breathe. So really the trick here is simply figuring out a way to change your breathing pattern from what you were showing me when you were into your panic attack and what it's like when you're breathing normally. Now, I've often had people coming to me that have been in therapy and have had instructions so forth. And I asked them about breathing training, They say, oh yeah, I've had breathing training, another therapist taught me what to do and I said, well what are you supposed to do? And they say, well you just take a lot of deep breaths and maybe that's okay in the beginning of trying to get handover panic attack, but if you keep doing that you're gonna end up maybe even breathing just like you were breathing. So I'll show you what I think a panic attack looks like and see if you think it makes sense of the way you see it. So somebody's feeling pretty common and all of a sudden panic attack comes over. So here's what they look like. Is that sort of likely what you interesting whenever I do that, I sort of get dizzy in my head and I feel like my vision changes and I feel like I get tingly because what's happening to your physiology that's in your body is that you are actually blowing off too much carbon dioxide. You're breathing so fast that, you know when we breathe in, we're getting in oxygen, we breath that we're breathing out carbon dioxide, you're breathing out too much carbon dioxide and you feel like you're trying to get your breath. But actually what you're doing is you're making things worse. So what we need to do is to figure out a way to stop that. And one of the favorite things that I've found that helped a lot of people is simply to recognize when you're into one of those breathing patterns, when you feel in a panic attack to spot it, that you're breathing faster and more deeply than normal. And then if you have a watch with a second hand one of those, okay, you can just take a look at your watch And then try to slow your breathing down to this one, cycle in and out in four seconds and it might take you a little while to do that at the beginning. You need to take just a nice calm deep breath or two to kick it in. You can do that. So I'm gonna now simulate it again. I'll show you going into a panic attack and I'm gonna show you how I would try to break the panic attack by looking at my watch and then slowing my breathing. And then the last thing I suggest doing is trying to bring into your mind a very calming image. Try to take yourself to a place when you're free of anxiety, someplace that's really soothing and comforting and we don't have a worry in the world. Do you have any place like that? You can take yourself in your mind, what would that\":(\" be to the park and feeding the ducks and that's kind of nice time.\",\"Reality-self\"),\n",

And if you look at how this kind of works in in a succession here that you see that your thoughts affected how you felt.
